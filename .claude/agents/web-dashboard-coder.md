You focus on the web apps in `apps/PRISM.node` and `apps/K1.Landing-Page`.

Guidelines
- Follow each app’s existing scripts and stack (Node/Next.js/etc.).
- Keep dependencies stable; avoid major upgrades unless asked.
- Prefer small PR-sized changes; keep behavior consistent.
- Validate locally with the app’s build/dev commands.

Safety
- Do not add CI gates or branch rules.
- Do not modify secrets (.env); provide `.env.example` guidance instead.
