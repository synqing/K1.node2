## Key Questions Answered

This architecture plan comprehensively answers all questions from the original request:

### Question 1: Core Allocation?
**Answer:** See AUDIO_INTEGRATION_ARCHITECTURE.md, Section 2 "Core Allocation & Synchronization"

Core 0: Audio DSP
- I2S acquisition (every 5 ms, 64 samples)
- Goertzel spectral analysis (50 Hz)
- Novelty curve and beat detection (50 Hz)
- Max utilization: ~40%

Core 1: LED Rendering
- Main loop @ 60 FPS
- Reads audio globals atomically
- Renders patterns
- Minimal blocked by audio

### Question 2: Buffer Ownership?
**Answer:** See AUDIO_INTEGRATION_ARCHITECTURE.md, Section 3.2 "Audio Sample Acquisition"

Ownership Model:
- **I2S ISR owns write:** Appends new 64-sample chunks
- **Analysis tasks own reads:** Consume buffer segments
- **Main loop reads globals:** Atomic memcpy, never blocks

Synchronization: Lock-free, no mutexes (avoids priority inversion)

### Question 3: I2S Pin Configuration?
**Answer:** See AUDIO_INTEGRATION_ARCHITECTURE.md, Section 3.1 "I2S Microphone Interface"

**Exact Pinout:**
```
ESP32-S3 Pin 14 → SPH0645 CLK
ESP32-S3 Pin 12 → SPH0645 LRCL
ESP32-S3 Pin 13 → SPH0645 OUT
ESP32-S3 GND   → SPH0645 GND + SEL
ESP32-S3 3.3V  → SPH0645 VCC
```

**I2S Configuration Constants:**
```cpp
Sample rate:    12,800 Hz
Bit width:      32-bit aligned (18-bit effective)
Format:         I2S standard mode
Channel:        RIGHT (SEL grounded)
Clock:          409.6 kHz (BCLK)
```

### Question 4: Update Rate?
**Answer:** See AUDIO_INTEGRATION_ARCHITECTURE.md, Section 8 "Update Rate Analysis"

Chosen rates with rationale:
- **I2S sampling:** 12,800 Hz (hardware fixed)
- **Chunk acquisition:** Every 5 ms (64 samples)
- **Novelty update:** 50 Hz (20 ms interval) - human perception threshold
- **Beat detection:** 50 Hz (progressive calculation, 2 bins/frame)
- **LED rendering:** 60 FPS (16.67 ms)

Why 50 Hz?
- Human perception sensitive to 20-40 Hz changes
- Avoids Core 0 CPU starvation
- Matches Emotiscope original design
- Smooth animation without jitter

### Question 5: Latency Tolerance?
**Answer:** See AUDIO_INTEGRATION_ARCHITECTURE.md, Section 8 "Latency Analysis"

**E2E Latency Timeline:**
```
Audio captured
    ├─ 1.25 ms (I2S ISR latency)
    ├─ 5 ms (max chunk buffer wait)
    ├─ 20 ms (max novelty update wait)
    └─ Total: ~41 ms to Core 0 processing complete

New frame rendered
    ├─ 0.5 ms (atomic state copy)
    ├─ 5 ms (pattern computation)
    ├─ 3 ms (RMT transmission)
    └─ Total: ~8.5 ms render latency

E2E TOTAL: ~50 ms (comfortable for beat sync, imperceptible to humans)
```

Tolerance: <100 ms is generally acceptable for beat sync. This design achieves ~50 ms, well within tolerance.
