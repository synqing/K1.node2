## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

1. **Project Managers:** Read AUDIO_ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md
   - Overview, timeline, resources, risks
   - 30 minutes

2. **Architects:** Read AUDIO_INTEGRATION_ARCHITECTURE.md § "Architecture Overview"
   - Block diagrams, core allocation, design decisions
   - 1-2 hours

3. **Developers:** Go to AUDIO_IMPLEMENTATION_TEMPLATES.md
   - Start with Template 1 (sample_buffer.h/cpp)
   - All code is ready to use
   - 2-3 weeks to implement

4. **Debuggers:** Bookmark AUDIO_QUICK_REFERENCE.md
   - Quick lookup when issues arise
   - 5-10 minutes per problem

## Key Architecture Decisions

| Decision | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Core allocation | Core 0 (audio DSP, 40% CPU) / Core 1 (LED rendering, 60 FPS) |
| Buffer ownership | I2S ISR writes, analysis tasks read (lock-free) |
| I2S pins | GPIO 14 (BCLK), GPIO 12 (WS), GPIO 13 (SD) |
| Update rate | 50 Hz novelty/tempo, 60 FPS LED rendering |
| Latency | ~50 ms E2E (audio capture to LED update) |

## What's Included

Architecture:
- [x] System block diagram
- [x] Dual-core task allocation
- [x] Core synchronization patterns
- [x] I2S hardware configuration
- [x] Audio processing pipeline
- [x] Latency analysis

Code:
- [x] sample_buffer.h/cpp (circular ring buffer)
- [x] dsp_pipeline.h/cpp (preprocessing)
- [x] i2s_manager.h/cpp (I2S + FreeRTOS)
- [x] main.cpp modifications (Core 0/1 split)
- [x] audio_state.h (atomic inter-core state)
- [x] integration_test.cpp (diagnostics)
- [x] platformio.ini (two build environments)

Testing:
- [x] 4-phase implementation plan
- [x] Success criteria for each phase
- [x] 5 common problems pre-diagnosed
- [x] Diagnostic commands
- [x] Performance targets

## Implementation Timeline

- **Phase 1 (1-2 weeks):** I2S foundation - real audio input
- **Phase 2 (1-2 weeks):** Spectral analysis - Goertzel FFT
- **Phase 3 (1 week):** Beat detection - tempo tracking
- **Phase 4 (1 week):** Chromagram - pitch analysis

**Total: 4-6 weeks** with testing and optimization

## Next Steps

1. **Read:** AUDIO_ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md (overview)
2. **Review:** Full AUDIO_INTEGRATION_ARCHITECTURE.md (understanding)
3. **Implement:** Start with AUDIO_IMPLEMENTATION_TEMPLATES.md (Phase 1)
4. **Debug:** Reference AUDIO_QUICK_REFERENCE.md when needed
