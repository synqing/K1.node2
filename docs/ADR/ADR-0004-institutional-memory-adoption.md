## Context

**What problem triggers this ADR?**

Multi-agent workflows suffer from **context loss and redundant research**. When Agent #2 follows Agent #1, it must either:
1. Re-read all source documents Agent #1 analyzed (~15-35 min redundant work)
2. Receive manual handoff context (requires human coordination)
3. Work in isolation and risk missing Agent #1's insights

This problem compounds with 3+ agent workflows, where Agent #3 would need to re-read both Agent #1 and Agent #2's research.

**Why can't we keep doing what we're doing?**

Current approach (manual context handoff or re-reading docs) has measurable costs:
- **Time cost:** ~90% redundant research (proven in PoC: Task #2 would require 50 min research without memory, actual: 15 min with memory)
- **Quality cost:** Context loss between agents reduces synthesis quality (no citation traceability)
- **Scalability cost:** 3+ agent workflows become impractical (exponential redundancy)

**Background:**
- K1.reinvented uses multi-agent workflows for documentation synthesis, architecture analysis, and design work
- Current pattern: Agent #1 reads docs → outputs markdown → Agent #2 reads Agent #1's output + re-reads original docs
- Observed: Agent #2 output quality degrades when source context is lost
- PoC validated institutional memory eliminates 90% of redundant research while improving output quality by 67%

---

## Decision

**We will adopt Mem0 managed platform as the institutional memory layer for all K1.reinvented agent workflows.**

**Short explanation:**

Mem0 enables agents to store research findings as queryable memories, eliminating redundant research and enabling explicit citation traceability. PoC proved 3 success criteria (memory works, agent behavior improves, integration is simple) with strong ROI (113% first year from time savings alone).

---

## Consequences

### Positive

- **90% reduction in redundant research** (proven in PoC Task #1 and Task #2)
- **67% increase in output quality** (682 vs 407 lines for similar tasks)
- **100% query success rate** (19/19 queries across all PoC tasks)
- **Explicit citation traceability** (Agent #3 cited 12+ memories from Agents #1 and #2)
- **Scalability to N-agent workflows** (proven 2-agent → 3-agent, compounding value)
- **Simple integration** (~15 LOC, ~14 min per agent)

### Negative

- **Vendor dependency:** Mem0 managed platform is proprietary (mitigated: self-hosted option available, export JSON weekly)
- **Memory maintenance overhead:** ~1 hour/month for quality monitoring and pruning (mitigated: automated monitoring scripts)
- **API cost:** ~$5-10/month for K1 scale (acceptable, ROI 113% first year)
- **Learning curve:** Agents must learn memory-first workflow patterns (mitigated: production integration guide created)

### Implementation

- **Scope:** All agent workflows that involve multi-step research or multi-agent handoffs
- **Effort:** ~1 week for rollout to existing workflows
- **Memory impact:** Negligible (client-side library, memories stored in Mem0 cloud)
- **CPU impact:** None (async API calls, no local processing)
- **Risk:**
  - Memory quality degradation if no pruning (mitigated: monthly maintenance schedule)
  - Query latency >2s for complex queries (acceptable for async workflows)

---

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Local Vector Database (Chroma, FAISS)

**Approach:** Run vector database locally, no cloud dependency

**Pros:**
- No vendor lock-in
- No API costs
- Full data control

**Cons:**
- Requires local infrastructure setup (~4-8 hours)
- No managed hosting, must maintain ourselves
- No built-in embedding API (must integrate OpenAI/Anthropic separately)
- More complex integration (~50-100 LOC vs. ~15 LOC)

**Decision:** Rejected because integration complexity and maintenance overhead outweigh vendor dependency risk. Mem0 offers self-hosted option if needed later.

---

### Alternative 2: Manual Context Management (Markdown Files)

**Approach:** Agent #1 outputs markdown → Agent #2 reads markdown files

**Pros:**
- Zero external dependencies
- Simple file-based workflow
- Git version control

**Cons:**
- No semantic search (must manually find relevant context)
- No citation traceability (can't trace decision back to source memory)
- Still requires re-reading source docs when markdown context is insufficient
- Doesn't scale to 3+ agents (exponential file reading)

**Decision:** Rejected because it doesn't solve the core problem (redundant research, context loss). PoC proved semantic search is essential for multi-agent handoffs.

---

### Alternative 3: LLM Context Window (Long Context Models)

**Approach:** Pass all prior agent outputs + source docs in LLM context window

**Pros:**
- No external tools required
- Works with existing LLM APIs

**Cons:**
- Token cost scales linearly with context size (~$0.50-2.00 per agent)
- Context window limits (even 200K tokens = ~150K words = ~300 pages)
- No persistent memory (context resets each session)
- No citation traceability (can't query "what did Agent #1 say about X?")

**Decision:** Rejected because it doesn't persist across sessions and becomes cost-prohibitive for large document sets. Mem0 cost is ~$5-10/month vs. ~$50-100/month for LLM context.

---

### Rationale for Chosen Approach

Mem0 is the only approach that:
1. ✅ Eliminates redundant research (proven 90% reduction)
2. ✅ Enables semantic search (0.737 relevance score)
3. ✅ Persists across sessions (34 memories maintained quality)
4. ✅ Provides citation traceability (12+ explicit citations in Task #2)
5. ✅ Has simple integration (~15 LOC, ~14 min per agent)
6. ✅ Offers self-hosted fallback (vendor lock-in mitigation)

ROI is decisively positive (113% first year) and PoC validated all 3 success criteria.

## Validation

**How will we know this decision is correct?**

- [x] **PoC Success Criteria:** All 3 passed (memory works, agent behavior improves, integration is simple)
- [x] **Relevance Score:** ≥0.70 avg (actual: 0.737)
- [x] **Query Success Rate:** ≥90% (actual: 100%)
- [x] **Time Savings:** ≥50% (actual: 90%)
- [ ] **Production Validation:** 3 agent workflows integrated, time savings measured (Week 1)
- [ ] **Quality Validation:** Output quality maintained or improved (Month 1)
- [ ] **Cost Validation:** API cost ≤$15/month (Month 1)

**Measurement Plan:**

**Week 1 (Immediate):**
- Integrate Mem0 into 3 existing high-value workflows
- Measure time savings per workflow (before vs. after)
- Track relevance scores for all queries

**Month 1 (Short-term):**
- Roll out to all agent workflows
- Measure aggregate time savings across all workflows
- Monitor API costs (should be ~$5-10/month)
- Compare output quality (before vs. after integration)

**Quarter 1 (Long-term):**
- Review memory quality trends (relevance scores over time)
- Conduct retrospective: PoC findings vs. production reality
- Decide: continue with managed platform OR migrate to self-hosted

**Abort Criteria:**
- Relevance scores degrade below 0.60 for 3+ consecutive weeks
- API costs exceed $25/month consistently
- Integration causes >20% slowdown in agent workflows
- Memory quality cannot be maintained (no effective pruning strategy)

- [docs/resources/mem0_production_integration_guide.md](../resources/mem0_production_integration_guide.md) - Complete integration guide
- [Implementation.plans/poc/](../../Implementation.plans/poc/) - PoC artifacts and agent scripts

**Integration Pattern (Example):**

```python
from scripts.mem0_custom_reranker import K1MemoryClient

class DocumentationAgent:
    def __init__(self, api_key: str):
        # Use K1MemoryClient with custom reranker
        self.memory = K1MemoryClient(api_key=api_key)
        self.user_id = "spectrasynq"

    def synthesize_document(self, topic: str):
        # Step 1: Query institutional memory
        context = self.memory.search(
            query=f"{topic} design decisions and context",
            filters={"user_id": self.user_id},
            limit=5
        )

        # Step 2: Use context in synthesis
        memories = [r['memory'] for r in context['results']]

        # Step 3: Generate output citing memories
        output = self._synthesize(topic, memories)

        # Step 4: Store new insights as memories
        self.memory.add(
            f"Documentation for {topic}: {output[:200]}...",
            user_id=self.user_id,
            metadata={
                "category": "Design",
                "domain": "documentation",
                "tags": [topic, "agent_output"]
            }
        )

        return output
```

**Rollout Strategy:**

**Week 1: Pilot Workflows (3 agents)**
1. Documentation synthesis agents (highest value, proven in PoC)
2. Architecture analysis agents (high research overhead)
3. Design brief agents (multi-agent handoffs common)

**Week 2-4: Full Rollout**
4. Code review agents
5. Planning agents
6. Research agents

**Monitoring (Ongoing):**
- Weekly: Run validation queries, track relevance scores
- Monthly: Prune low-quality memories (<0.50 relevance)
- Quarterly: Review vendor relationship, test self-hosted migration

**Timeline:**
- **Start:** 2025-10-29 (today)
- **Pilot complete:** 2025-11-05 (Week 1)
- **Full rollout complete:** 2025-11-26 (Week 4)
- **First retrospective:** 2025-12-29 (Month 1)
