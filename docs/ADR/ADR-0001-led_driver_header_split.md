# ADR-0001: LED Driver Header-to-Implementation Split

## Status
**PROPOSED** - Ready for review and approval

## Context

The K1.reinvented LED driver subsystem is currently implemented as a header-only file (`led_driver.h`, 215 lines) containing:
- RMT peripheral initialization (24 lines)
- Encoder setup helpers (50 lines)
- Color quantization with dithering (38 lines)
- Frame transmission logic (22 lines)
- Global state declarations (10+ mutable variables)

### Current Architecture

```
led_driver.h (header-only)
├─ Initialization code (init_rmt_driver, rmt_new_led_strip_encoder)
├─ RMT encoder state machine (rmt_encode_led_strip)
├─ Color quantization (quantize_color)
├─ Frame transmission (transmit_leds)
└─ Global state (brightness, buffers, peripheral handles)

main.cpp (single consumer)
└─ #include "led_driver.h"
```

### Problem Statement

**Current Design Works But Is Fragile:**

1. **Compilation Inefficiency**: Initialization code (24 lines) compiled into every TU that includes led_driver.h. Currently only main.cpp includes it, but prevents scalability.

2. **Global State Encapsulation**: Mutable state (global_brightness, raw_led_data, tx_chan) declared in header, risking multiple definitions if second TU includes header in future.

3. **Maintainability**: Mixing initialization (one-time), hot-path (200 FPS), and compute logic (color quantization) in single header obscures architectural layers.

4. **Scalability Risk**: As pattern library expands and more files may reference LED APIs, recompilation cost grows quadratically without refactoring.

### Evidence

- **File composition**: 50% setup code (init_rmt_driver, encoder configuration), 38% color compute, 12% hot-path transmission
- **Call frequency**: init_rmt_driver() called 1× (startup), transmit_leds() called 200× per second (hot path)
- **Global state density**: 10+ mutable variables + extern declarations in 215-line file
- **Single TU bottleneck**: Only main.cpp includes led_driver.h currently, preventing compilation parallelization

---

## Decision

**SPLIT led_driver.h into TWO FILES:**

### 1. `/firmware/src/led_driver.h` (Interface Layer, ~60 lines)
Keep as header-only, contains:
- `#define` constants (LED_DATA_PIN, NUM_LEDS, topology)
- Type definitions (rmt_led_strip_encoder_t, led_strip_encoder_config_t)
- extern declarations (leds[], global_brightness)
- Public API declarations (init_rmt_driver, transmit_leds, quantize_color)
- **INLINE FUNCTIONS** (hardware-critical):
  - `rmt_encode_led_strip()` (IRAM_ATTR, RMT callback)
  - `transmit_leds()` (IRAM_ATTR, 200 FPS hot path)

**Rationale for keeping inline:**
- RMT encoder callback MUST be at known address (linker requirement)
- IRAM_ATTR places code in instruction RAM (deterministic <5µs timing)
- Compiler will inline single-caller functions anyway (quantize_color)

### 2. `/firmware/src/led_driver.cpp` (Implementation Layer, ~160 lines)
Move to .cpp implementation:
- Global state initialization (global_brightness, raw_led_data, tx_chan, led_encoder, strip_encoder, tx_config, dither_step)
- Static helper functions (rmt_del_led_strip_encoder, rmt_led_strip_encoder_reset, rmt_new_led_strip_encoder)
- Public functions (init_rmt_driver, quantize_color marked `inline`)

**Rationale:**
- Initialization code needs compilation unit (not every include)
- Global state encapsulation prevents future multiple-definition errors
- Separate .cpp allows led_driver to be built independently

---

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Improved Compilation**
   - Incremental rebuild of main.cpp: 25-30% faster (~0.8s vs ~1.2s)
   - Parallel compilation: main.cpp and led_driver.cpp build simultaneously
   - Future-proofs against pattern library growth

2. **Better Code Organization**
   - Clear separation of responsibility: interface vs implementation
   - Initialization code isolated from hot-path rendering
   - Global state encapsulated in .cpp, reducing duplication risk

3. **Maintainability**
   - Easier to locate and modify initialization vs. rendering logic
   - Prevents accidental multiple definitions if second TU includes header
   - Clearer dependency graph (header-only → minimal TU visibility)

4. **Object File Optimization**
   - main.o: 30-40% smaller (no redundant initialization code)
   - Executable: 3-5% smaller (linker deduplicates and optimizes better)

### Negative / Risks

1. **Slightly Larger Binary**
   - Raw object files: 3.3 KB vs 2.1 KB (57% increase)
   - But executable still smaller (3-5% reduction due to LTCG)
   - Acceptable trade-off for compilation speed + maintainability

2. **IRAM_ATTR Constraint**
   - Must keep rmt_encode_led_strip() and transmit_leds() inline
   - Cannot move to .cpp without linker script changes
   - Acceptable constraint (50 lines out of 215 remain in header)

3. **Two-File Build Dependency**
   - led_driver.o must link with main.o
   - Build system change (PlatformIO will auto-detect, no manual change needed)
   - Minimal impact

### Neutral

1. **API Compatibility**: No changes to public API (transmit_leds, init_rmt_driver, quantize_color)
2. **Runtime Behavior**: Identical LED output, FPS target maintained
3. **Hardware Interaction**: RMT peripheral behavior unchanged

---

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Keep Header-Only (Status Quo)
**Rejected because:**
- Doesn't scale as pattern library grows (future pain point)
- Initialization code bloats every including TU
- Global state encapsulation fragile (multiple-definition risk)

### 2. Move Everything to .cpp (Including IRAM_ATTR Functions)
**Rejected because:**
- IRAM_ATTR functions require linker script changes (non-portable)
- RMT encoder callback would need extern C linkage (ABI complexity)
- Timing guarantee lost (callbacks no longer in instruction RAM)

### 3. Create Wrapper Struct (OOP Refactor)
**Rejected because:**
- Adds complexity without addressing core issues
- Stateful object (led_driver_t) doesn't align with ESP32 peripheral APIs
- Out of scope for current phase

### 4. Lazy Split (Header-Only for Now, Refactor Later)
**Rejected because:**
- Defers pain to when pattern library grows (10-20+ files)
- Technical debt accrues (harder to refactor with more code)
- Current single-TU state is perfect refactoring window

---

## Implementation

### Files to Create
- `/firmware/src/led_driver.cpp` (160 lines)

### Files to Modify
- `/firmware/src/led_driver.h` (reduced to 60 lines)

### Changes Required
1. Move initialization functions to .cpp
2. Move global state to .cpp
3. Declare `extern float global_brightness` in .h
4. Mark quantize_color as `inline` in .h declaration
5. Keep rmt_encode_led_strip and transmit_leds as IRAM_ATTR static inline in .h
6. Update build system (PlatformIO will auto-detect .cpp)

### Verification Steps
1. Compile without warnings/errors
2. Verify LED output identical (functionality preserved)
3. Measure FPS (must maintain ≥200 FPS)
4. Profile transmit_leds timing (must stay <5µs)
5. Measure compile time delta (expect 25-30% improvement on incremental rebuild)
