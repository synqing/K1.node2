# K1 Control App - Performance Baseline

**Captured**: 2025-10-27  
**Branch**: feature/control-interface-revolution  
**Commit**: e962360

## Build Metrics

### Bundle Size
- **CSS**: 43KB (8.4KB gzipped)
- **JavaScript**: 773KB (228.7KB gzipped)
- **Total**: 816KB (237.1KB gzipped)

### Build Performance
- **Build Time**: 1.62 seconds
- **Modules Transformed**: 2,322
- **Vite Version**: 6.4.1

### Build Warnings
- Large chunk warning (>500KB) - expected for initial bundle
- Recommendation: Consider code-splitting for production

## Development Server

### Startup Performance
- **Cold Start**: 367ms (Vite ready time)
- **Port**: 3000
- **Hot Reload**: Enabled

### Dependencies
- **Total Packages**: 326
- **Security Issues**: 0 (after npm audit fix)
- **Node Version**: Compatible with 18+

## Target Performance Goals

### Response Time Targets
- **Parameter Changes**: <100ms (UI to LED response)
- **Pattern Selection**: <2 seconds (click to LED activation)
- **App Startup**: <3 seconds (load to interactive)

### Resource Targets
- **Memory Usage**: <150MB sustained
- **CPU Usage**: <5% idle, <15% active
- **Bundle Size**: Maintain or reduce current size

### Frame Rate Targets
- **UI Interactions**: 60+ FPS
- **LED Visualization**: 60+ FPS (when implemented)
- **Audio Visualization**: 30+ FPS (when implemented)

## Current Status

### âœ… Baseline Established
- Clean build with no errors
- Security vulnerabilities resolved
- Development server functional
- TypeScript compilation working

### ðŸ“Š Measurements Needed
These will be captured during Task #1 (Codebase Audit):
- Actual app startup time in browser
- Memory usage during idle state
- Initial render performance
- Network request timing to K1 device

### ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria
The Control Interface Revolution will be considered successful when:
- All response time targets are met
- Resource usage stays within limits
- User experience feels professional and responsive
- No performance regressions from baseline

## Testing Methodology

### Performance Testing Plan
1. **Startup Time**: Measure from page load to interactive
2. **Memory Usage**: Monitor during 30-minute session
3. **Response Time**: Measure parameter change to LED response
4. **Frame Rate**: Monitor during heavy UI interactions
5. **Bundle Analysis**: Track size growth during development

### Tools for Measurement
- **Browser DevTools**: Performance tab, Memory tab
- **Lighthouse**: Overall performance scoring
- **Bundle Analyzer**: Code splitting opportunities
- **Network Tab**: API response timing

## Notes

- Current bundle size is reasonable for a professional control application
- Vite's fast build times support rapid development iteration
- Hot reload functionality will accelerate development workflow
- Security baseline is clean - no vulnerabilities to address

This baseline will be referenced throughout development to ensure performance targets are met and no regressions occur.
