# PF-5 Executive Brief: Readiness & Timeline

**Bottom Line**: PF-5 Phase 1 is **execution-ready immediately** (85% code complete). Phase C transfer clears the path. Palette discovery cuts Phase 2-5 effort by **15+ days**. Expected ship date: **Week 28-30** (August 2025).

---

## READINESS STATUS

| Phase | Scope | Code | Blockers | Ready? |
|-------|-------|------|----------|--------|
| **1** | Audio Reactivity | **85%** | ✅ None | **YES** |
| **2** | Palette Selector | **0%** | ✅ None | **Weeks 13-16** |
| **3** | Text-to-Lighting | **0%** | ⚠️ Model licensing | **Weeks 17-20** |
| **4** | Personalization | **0%** | ✅ None | **Weeks 21-26** |
| **5** | Safety & Polish | **0%** | ✅ None | **Weeks 27-28** |

---

## KEY DISCOVERY: PALETTE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE

**ALERT**: `firmware/src/palettes.h` contains **33 production-tested gradient palettes**.

**Impact**: Phase 2 is NOT "train ML to extract colors from images." It's **"route audio features to palette selection."**

**Time saved**: 15+ days (Phase 2 drops from 18 days → 4 days)

**Palettes** (by category):
- **Warm** (fire, sunset, lava, magenta): 8 palettes
- **Cool** (ocean, coral, blue, emerald): 6 palettes
- **Vibrant** (rainbow, pink splash, colorful): 7 palettes
- **Mood** (ambient, vintage, landscape): 12 palettes

---

## PHASE C TRANSFER IMPACT

**Status**: Phase C transferred to separate team.

**Impact on PF-5**: ✅ **ZERO BLOCKERS**
- K1Provider already extended (no changes needed)
- Audio/palette code is independent
- Timeline unaffected

---

| **Total** | **66 days** | **4-5 engineers** | **Low** |

---

## PHASE 1: WHAT'S LEFT TO DO

**Status**: 85% code complete. Remaining: **validation, edge cases, mobile testing.**

**Deliverables**:
- ✅ 5 audio-reactive presets (implemented)
- ✅ Beat detection algorithm (implemented)
- ✅ AudioWorklet processor (210 lines, production code)
- ⚠️ Latency validation (in progress)
- ⚠️ Beat accuracy testing (in progress)
- ⚠️ Mobile audio (iOS/Android)
- ⚠️ Browser compatibility (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
- ⚠️ Edge cases (very low tempo, silence, speech)

**Team**:
- 1 Audio Validation Engineer (90%)
- 1 Frontend Engineer (50%)

**Duration**: Weeks 1-12 (28 days work)

**Go/No-Go Gate**: Week 12
- Beat accuracy >85% (MIREX dataset)
- Latency <30ms (browser)
- Mobile audio working
- All platforms tested

---

## PHASE 2: SMART PALETTE SELECTOR

**Status**: Algorithm designed. Awaiting implementation.

**What It Does**:
- Listen to audio features (spectral centroid, energy, tempo)
- Select best-matching palette from 33 available
- Let firmware `color_from_palette()` interpolate within gradient
- User can favorite/lock palettes via UI

**Algorithm Example**:
```
if energy > 70 && centroid < 500:  use Lava palette (intense fire)
if tempo > 150 && energy > 60:     use Rainbow Sherbet (fast colors)
if centroid < 200:                 use Fire palette (bass-heavy)
if centroid > 3000:                use Ocean Breeze (treble-bright)
```

**Team**: 1 Full-stack Engineer

**Duration**: Weeks 13-16 (4 days)
- 1 day: Algorithm finalization
- 1 day: Testing with 10+ music samples
- 1 day: UI components (palette browser, favorites)
- 1 day: Integration + polish

**Effort**: 4 days vs. original 18 days = **14 days saved**

---

## PHASE 3: TEXT-TO-LIGHTING

**Status**: Design finalized. Awaiting model setup.

**What It Does**:
- User types or speaks: "warm ambient vibes"
- MiniLM embedding + intent classification
- Maps intent to best palette + preset combination
- <150ms latency (text input → LED response)

**Intent Classes** (7 total):
- warm, cool, energetic, calm, bright, dark, moody

**Team**: 1 Full-stack Engineer

**Duration**: Weeks 17-20 (14 days)
- 3 days: MiniLM model setup + quantization
- 3 days: Intent classification fine-tuning
- 3 days: Text/voice input UI
- 3 days: Integration + testing
- 2 days: Latency validation + polish

**Blockers**:
- ⚠️ MiniLM licensing confirmation (Apache 2.0 expected)
- ⚠️ Model quantization for browser (<5 MB target)

---

## PHASE 4: PERSONALIZATION & LEARNING

**Status**: Design finalized. Awaiting implementation.

**What It Does**:
- Track user feedback (👍 👎 on each effect)
- Learn preferences via EMA (exponential moving average)
- A/B test different effect variants
- Show preference trends over time

**Learning Formula**:
```
preference_new = 0.9 * preference_old + 0.1 * feedback
(Recent feedback weighted 10%, historical 90%)
```

**Team**:
- 1 Full-stack Engineer (learning + feedback)
- 1 Backend Engineer (analytics, optional)

**Duration**: Weeks 21-26 (12 days)
- 3 days: Preference storage + EMA algorithm
- 3 days: Feedback UI + rating system
- 3 days: A/B testing framework
- 2 days: Analytics dashboard (optional)
- 1 day: Integration + validation

**Success Criteria**:
- User preferences trending upward after 20 interactions
- A/B test shows variant winner by Week 26

---

## PHASE 5: SAFETY & OPTIMIZATION

**Status**: Requirements defined. Awaiting implementation.

**What It Does**:
- Photosensitivity validation (<3 Hz flashing)
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility audit
- Device capability detection (old phones, low-end hardware)
- Stress testing (99.9% uptime)
- Battery/memory optimization

**Team**:
- 1 Full-stack Engineer (safety checks)
- 1 QA Engineer (testing + validation)

**Duration**: Weeks 27-28 (8 days)
- 2 days: Photosensitivity validator
- 2 days: WCAG audit + fixes
- 2 days: Device testing (iPhone SE, Galaxy S8)
- 2 days: Stress testing + documentation

**Success Criteria**:
- Zero photosensitivity violations
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- 99.9% uptime in 48-hour stress test
- Runs on 3-year-old devices
