## Critical Path Items

### 1. Phase C Transfer (Day 1)
**Owner**: @spectrasynq
**Status**: ⏳ PENDING APPROVAL
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Confirm target team (who owns Phase C?)
- [ ] Document K1Provider interface (already extended, no changes)
- [ ] Create git branch on target repo: `feature/phase-c-node-editor`
- [ ] Transfer 15-20 Phase C tasks to target backlog
- [ ] Record transfer in `docs/reports/PHASE_C_TRANSFER_HANDOFF.md`

**Deliverable**: Phase C fully transferred, zero impact on PF-5 timeline
**Risk**: HIGH if not assigned immediately (blocks all decisions)
**Mitigation**: Assign ownership TODAY

---

### 2. Phase 1 Validation Infrastructure (Days 1-2)

**Owner**: Audio Validation Engineer (TBD)
**Status**: ⏳ PENDING TEAM ASSIGNMENT

#### Latency Measurement
- [ ] Add performance.now() timestamps to AudioWorklet.process()
- [ ] Log before/after latency (target: <3ms per 1024-sample buffer)
- [ ] Browser DevTools profiling setup (Chrome Timeline)
- [ ] Expected result: 6-11ms browser processing latency

#### Beat Accuracy Testing
- [ ] Download SMC dataset: `git clone https://github.com/marl/smcdb.git`
- [ ] Organize: beats/{audio, reference, estimated, results}/
- [ ] Create test harness: `beats/test_beat_detection.py`
- [ ] Verify mir_eval installation: `pip install mir_eval librosa numpy scipy`
- [ ] Test on 1 "easy" file (easy_001.wav) → expected F-Measure 0.75+

#### Browser Compatibility Matrix
- [ ] Chrome (latest 2 versions)
- [ ] Firefox (latest 2 versions)
- [ ] Safari (iOS + desktop)
- [ ] Document any platform-specific quirks

#### Mobile Audio Testing
- [ ] iPhone: getUserMedia permissions, audio context setup
- [ ] Android: Same testing flow
- [ ] Test actual devices (not emulators)
- [ ] Document any platform-specific audio latency

**Deliverable**: Test infrastructure ready, all tests automated
**Risk**: MEDIUM (requires K1 hardware access)
**Mitigation**: Ensure at least 1 test device allocated

---

### 3. Phase 1 Code Readiness (Day 1)

**Owner**: Frontend Engineer (TBD)
**Status**: ⏳ PENDING TEAM ASSIGNMENT

#### TypeScript / Linting
- [ ] `npm run type-check` (resolve zero errors)
- [ ] `npm run lint -- src/audio/` (fix style violations)
- [ ] Remove console.log() calls
- [ ] Review AudioFeatures interface export

#### Unit Tests
- [ ] Test preset 1: Beat Pulse mapping (brightness, hue)
- [ ] Test preset 2: Energy Wave (spectral content)
- [ ] Test preset 3: Spectrum Rainbow (full spectrum)
- [ ] Test preset 4: Bass Drop (low frequency trigger)
- [ ] Test preset 5: Ambient Flow (gentle transitions)
- [ ] Mock AudioFeatures with test data
- [ ] Verify hue/saturation/brightness ranges (0-360, 0-100, 0-100)

#### Component Tests
- [ ] Mount/unmount AudioReactivePresets component
- [ ] Verify preset selection triggers startListening()
- [ ] Verify K1 sendCommand() called on features update
- [ ] Test error cases (no microphone, permission denied)

#### Documentation
- [ ] API documentation: useAudioReactivity hook
- [ ] API documentation: AudioReactivePreset interface
- [ ] API documentation: AudioFeatures structure
- [ ] Developer guide: How to add a new preset
- [ ] User documentation (draft): Feature overview, permissions, troubleshooting

**Deliverable**: Code audit passing, tests green, docs started
**Risk**: LOW (code already 85% complete)
**Mitigation**: None needed

---

### 4. ML Infrastructure Planning (Days 2-3)

**Owner**: ML Engineer (TBD, 20-30% part-time)
**Status**: ⏳ PENDING TEAM ASSIGNMENT

#### Phase 2 Scope Confirmation
- [ ] Confirm: Palette routing (4 days) NOT ML color extraction
- [ ] Review `firmware/src/palettes.h` (33 gradient palettes)
- [ ] Design audio feature → palette index mapping
- [ ] Prepare 10+ music samples for algorithm calibration

#### Phase 3 Model Sourcing (Text-to-Lighting)
- [ ] Research MiniLM embedding model
- [ ] Verify licensing: Apache 2.0 or MIT (✓ expected)
- [ ] Find quantized version: <5 MB for browser
- [ ] Test compatibility: transformers.js or ONNX Runtime
- [ ] Document setup steps + performance targets (<150ms latency)

#### Architecture Documentation
- [ ] Phase 2 design doc: Audio features → palette mapping
- [ ] Phase 3 design doc: Text → embedding → intent → palette+preset
- [ ] Phase 4 design doc: EMA learning + A/B testing framework
- [ ] Library evaluation: ONNX Runtime, color-math libs, embedding frameworks

**Deliverable**: Model sources identified, design docs drafted
**Risk**: MEDIUM (MiniLM licensing TBD)
**Mitigation**: Start research immediately, have backup model

## Decision Gates

### Before Week 1 Execution (MUST PASS ALL)
- [ ] **Phase C transfer CONFIRMED** (ownership documented)
- [ ] **Test infrastructure APPROVED** (latency, beat, compatibility)
- [ ] **Code audit PASSING** (type-check, lint, basic tests)
- [ ] **Team assignments LOCKED IN** (both engineers committed)
- [ ] **K1 hardware AVAILABLE** (at least 1 device for testing)

**Go Decision Criteria**:
- ✅ All 5 gates must pass = **GO FOR WEEK 1**
- ❌ 1+ gates fail = **DELAY WEEK 1, escalate to @spectrasynq**

**Current Status**: 3/5 gates passed (Phase 1 code ready, MIREX infrastructure documented, roadmap approved)
