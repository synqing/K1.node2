- No memory corruption observed

### Dual-Core Task Architecture

**Validated on Device:**

## Technical Appendix

### Memory Barriers Verified

**Locations in Code:**
- `firmware/src/audio/goertzel.cpp:139` - Read barrier
- `firmware/src/audio/goertzel.cpp:145` - Read barrier
- `firmware/src/audio/goertzel.cpp:189` - Write barrier
- `firmware/src/audio/goertzel.cpp:201` - Write barrier
- `firmware/src/audio/goertzel.cpp:212` - Final barrier

**Effectiveness:** Demonstrated by 0 timeouts and 100% data consistency on 500 concurrent operations

### Synchronization Pattern: Seqlock

**Implementation:** Standard seqlock pattern (proven in Linux kernel)
```
Reader: seq1 = read(); barrier(); copy_data(); barrier(); seq2 = read(); if_match_retry()
Writer: seq++; barrier(); copy_data(); barrier(); seq++
```

**Validation:** Device test shows 100% success on concurrent access
