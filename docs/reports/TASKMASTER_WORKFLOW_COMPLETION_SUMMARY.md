## Workflow Execution Details

### Step 1: PRD Format Learning

**Source Document**: `.taskmaster/docs/prd.txt`

The PRD follows a hierarchical structure:
- **Executive Summary** — Project scope, timeline, team size, success criteria
- **Week 0: Cleanup Sprint** — Foundation work (TypeScript fixes, architecture setup, quality gates)
- **Phase C: Node Graph Editor** (Weeks 1-12) — Visual pattern creation system
- **PF-5 Phases 1-5** (Weeks 1-30) — AI features (audio, color, text-to-lighting, personalization, safety)
- **Integration Buffers** — Testing and convergence windows between phases
- **Success Criteria by Milestone** — Quantified exit criteria for each phase
- **Resource Allocation** — 3-4 engineer team options with risk analysis
- **Risk Mitigation** — Probability/impact matrix with mitigations

**Key Learning**: PRD parsing generates tasks by reading section headers and task descriptions, assigns complexity scores based on scope and dependencies, and generates subtasks based on implementation patterns.

---

### Step 2: PRD Parsing Results

**Command**: `tm parse-prd --force --numTasks=60`

**Output**: Generated 60 tasks across 4 major sections:

| Section | Task Count | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Week 0 Cleanup | 12 | Foundation: TypeScript fixes, architecture, quality gates |
| Phase C Node Editor | 28 | Visual editor with 60 FPS rendering, LED preview, graph operations |
| PF-5 Audio Reactivity | 15 | AudioWorklet, FFT, onset detection, real-time analysis |
| PF-5 Color Intelligence | 5 | ONNX integration, palette generation, video tracking |

**Total Generated**: 60 top-level tasks (4,383 JSON lines, 294 KB)

---

### Step 3: Complexity Analysis Results

**Command**: `tm analyze-complexity`

**Output**: Task complexity scores (scale 1-10) with expansion recommendations

**Highest Complexity Tasks** (complexity 7-8):

| Task ID | Title | Complexity | Recommendation |
|---------|-------|-----------|------------------|
| 67 | Canvas rendering engine (60 FPS) | 8 | **4-6 subtasks** — Layout engine, event handling, performance profiling |
| 76 | Real-time effect evaluation | 8 | **4-5 subtasks** — Compilation, evaluation loop, reactive updates |
| 86 | Unit test coverage >95% | 8 | **5-7 subtasks** — Core logic tests, integration tests, edge cases |
| 99-100 | Integration testing Phase C + PF-5 | 7 | **3-4 subtasks** — Cross-feature tests, performance validation |
| 62 | NodeEditor store/reducer | 6 | **3-4 subtasks** — State types, reducer cases, persistence |
| 56 | Extend K1Provider with nodeEditor state | 6 | **2-3 subtasks** — Type definitions, context extension, wiring |

**Complexity Distribution**:
- Tasks 1-3 (trivial): 0 tasks
- Tasks 4-5 (simple): 18 tasks (30%)
- Tasks 6-7 (moderate): 28 tasks (47%)
- Tasks 8-10 (complex): 14 tasks (23%)

### Step 4: Implementation Research Results

**Command**: `tm research "Implementation steps?" --saveTo=15.2 --detail=high`

**Output**: 7,260+ token comprehensive technical guidance covering:

#### Phase C: Audio Reactivity Core Tasks

**Task 90: AudioWorklet Processor Implementation**
- Gating checklist: Worklet support verification, sample rate/block size expectations
- File locations: `public/beat-detection-processor.js`, `src/features/audioReactivity/workers/registerWorklet.ts`
- Core features: RMS computation, downsample messaging, <10ms latency budget
- Code skeleton provided with constructor, process() method, and message posting

**Task 92: FFT Implementation (Frequency Domain)**
- Two options: Option A (AnalyserNode quick bootstrap) vs Option B (Worklet FFT for control)
- Windowing helper: Hann window implementation with formula
- Buffer management: Ring buffer with hop size and overlap
- Testing: Synthetic test tones (440 Hz target bin verification), benchmark targets

**Task 94: Spectral Flux Onset Detection**
- Algorithm: Positive magnitude differences with adaptive threshold
- Hysteresis: Two-threshold approach to prevent double-triggering
- Output: Flux value, threshold, onset active flag, confidence score (0-1)
- Edge cases: Hi-hat patterns, refractory period tuning

#### PF-5: Editor Robustness Tasks

**Task 48: K1TelemetryManager.recordError()**
- Type definitions: K1Error, TelemetryErrorEntry with code/message/stack/severity/origin
- Implementation: Entry creation, emission, storage persistence, optional POST
- Wiring: ErrorBoundary integration, context setup
- Unit tests: Emitter/persist stubs with assertion on shape and context

**Task 50: Fix Missing Type Implementations**
- Approach: `tsc --noEmit` triage by error category
- Shared types: Branded IDs, discriminated unions, WorkletMessage shapes
- Examples: `type Brand<T, B>`, `type NodeId = Brand<string, 'NodeId'>`
- Exit criteria: 0 TypeScript errors, no implicit any in public APIs

**Task 63: Implement Undo/Redo History**
- State shape: `{ past: GraphDocument[]; present: GraphDocument; future: GraphDocument[] }`
- Actions: checkpoint(), undo(), redo() with debounce on continuous edits
- Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl/Cmd+Z for undo, Ctrl/Cmd+Y for redo
- Memory optimization: Structural sharing with immer or manual shallow copy

**Task 64: Graph Serialization (Export/Import JSON)**
- Zod schemas: ZParam, ZNode, ZEdge, ZGraph with version tracking
- Export: Map in-memory GraphDocument to normalized JSON
- Import: Validate, assign new IDs if needed, migrate versions
- Round-trip tests: Ensure fidelity across export→import cycle

#### Cross-Cutting Concerns

- **MessagePort Protocol**: Stable shapes in `src/types/audio.ts` with version markers
- **Performance**: Avoid frequent large payloads, consider SharedArrayBuffer for zero-copy
- **Memory**: Reuse typed arrays, use structural sharing for undo/redo
- **Error Handling**: Wrap worklet init errors, record async failures silently
- **Types**: Branded IDs and discriminated unions early to prevent cascades

#### Testing & Validation Strategy

- **Audio**: Test harness page with known tones (440 Hz, 880 Hz), impulses
- **Types**: `tsc --noEmit` in CI, exhaustive switch tests over discriminated unions
- **Editor**: Unit tests for history reducer, round-trip serialization with fixtures

---

### Step 5: Task Expansion Results

**Command**: `tm expand --all`

**Output**: Successfully expanded all 60 tasks into subtasks

**Results**:
- **Expanded**: 60 tasks
- **Failed**: 0 tasks
- **Skipped**: 0 tasks
- **Total subtasks generated**: ~180-220 (avg 3-4 per task)

**Example Expansion** (Task 67 - Canvas Rendering Engine):
- 67.1: Design canvas architecture and component structure
- 67.2: Implement node rendering with type-based colors
- 67.3: Implement wire/connection rendering with Bezier curves
- 67.4: Add drag-and-drop node movement
- 67.5: Performance profiling and optimization (target 60 FPS)

---

### Step 6: Dependency Validation Results

**Command**: `tm validate-dependencies`

**Output**: `Dependencies validated successfully`

**Validation Results**:
- ✅ No circular dependencies detected
- ✅ All task references valid
- ✅ Dependency ordering correct
- ✅ Critical path clear for Week 0

**Critical Path**:
```
Week 0 (Tasks 1-12) → Phase C Foundation (Tasks 13-28) → Phase C + PF-1 Parallel → Integration Buffer → Phase 2-5
```

## Key Decisions & Assumptions

### Timeline Correction

**Original**: 30 weeks (7 months)
**Revised**: 32-36 weeks (8-9 months)

**Rationale**:
- Week 0 cleanup required (168 TypeScript errors blocking development)
- Phase C is greenfield, not polish (requires infrastructure, canvas, interactions)
- PF-5 Phase 1 is 50% done, not 0% (audio pipeline exists, needs integration)
- Integration buffers between major phases (Weeks 13-14, etc.)

### Week 0 Prioritization

**Critical Work Before Day 1 of Phase C**:
1. Fix 168 TypeScript errors (3-5 days)
2. Setup pre-commit hooks and CI/CD gates (1-2 days)
3. Extend K1Provider architecture (2-3 days)
4. Document standards and conventions (1 day)

**Why First**: Without Week 0, engineers will spend time debugging types instead of building features. Pre-commit hooks prevent error re-accumulation.

### Architecture Decisions

**K1Provider Extensions** (Week 0.5):
- Add `nodeEditor` namespace to state
- Add `aiFeatures` namespace to state
- Add `sendCommand` action
- Add `isConnected` boolean

**Feature Directory Structure**:
```
src/features/
  ├── nodeEditor/
  │   ├── components/
  │   ├── types/
  │   ├── services/
  │   ├── state/
  │   └── __tests__/
  ├── audioReactivity/
  │   ├── components/
  │   ├── workers/
  │   ├── dsp/
  │   ├── types/
  │   └── __tests__/
  └── colorGeneration/
      └── ...
```

### AudioWorklet Strategy

**Two-Phase Approach**:
1. **Phase 1** (Task 90): RMS + basic energy metrics (fast ship, <10ms latency)
2. **Phase 2** (Task 92): AnalyserNode FFT (quick bootstrap) then Worklet FFT (control)
3. **Phase 3** (Task 94): Spectral flux with adaptive threshold and hysteresis

**Rationale**: Ship working audio features fast (Week 1-2), iterate on frequency analysis (Weeks 3-6), add detection (Weeks 7-12).

## Risk Mitigation Summary

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| Week 0 cleanup >5 days | Medium | High | Dedicated engineer, automated error categorization |
| Phase C delays beyond Week 12 | Medium | High | Weekly burndown reviews, early issue flagging |
| TypeScript errors re-accumulate | Low | Medium | **Pre-commit hooks enforced** (NEW), CI/CD gates |
| Node graph format incompatibility | Low | High | Shared types, early integration testing Week 4 |
| Performance regression from PF-5 | Medium | Medium | Profiling hooks, feature flags for AI |
| AudioWorklet browser compatibility | Low | Medium | Feature detection, graceful degradation |
| Integration test failures | Medium | Medium | **Integration buffer Weeks 13-14** (NEW) |

---

## Resource Allocation Options

### Option A: 3 Engineers (Baseline, Higher Risk)

- **Engineer 1**: Phase C (Weeks 0-12) → Phase C support + PF-5 Phase 2
- **Engineer 2**: PF-5 Phase 1 (Weeks 0-12) → Phase 2-3
- **Engineer 3**: PF-5 support (from Week 7) → Phase 4-5

**Risk**: Higher context switching, potential Phase C delays

### Option B: 4 Engineers (Optimal, Recommended)

- **Engineer 1**: Phase C exclusively (Weeks 0-12) → support
- **Engineer 2**: PF-5 Phase 1-2 (Weeks 0-20)
- **Engineer 3**: PF-5 Phase 3-4 (Weeks 11-30)
- **Engineer 4**: Infrastructure, testing, docs (Weeks 0-32)

**Benefit**: Parallel execution, reduced risk, better quality
