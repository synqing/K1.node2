## Recommendations

### If PASS (8+ queries passed)
1. Proceed to Decision Gate (Phase 5)
2. Review PoC results against 3 success criteria
3. Create ADR for production integration
4. Plan Phase 1 implementation

### If CONDITIONAL (6-7 queries passed)
1. Implement custom K1 reranker (10-15% improvement expected)
2. Prune low-relevance memories (<0.50 score)
3. Re-run validation queries
4. If improvement, proceed to Decision Gate

### If FAIL (<6 queries passed)
1. Analyze gaps in memory coverage
2. Extract missing context from source documents
3. Improve memory tagging and metadata
4. Re-run validation queries
5. Consider alternative approaches if still failing
