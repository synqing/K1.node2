# Phase C Node Editor Wireframe: Alignment Assessment

## TL;DR

**Status**: 57% complete - **NOT READY FOR DEPLOYMENT** ‚ùå

The wireframe has solid foundations (UI, canvas, styling) but **missing critical features** (search, undo, shortcuts, import/export, copy/paste, metadata, onboarding) that block Phase C deployment.

---

## Scorecard

| Pillar | Score | Status | Assessment |
|--------|-------|--------|------------|
| **C.1 Infrastructure** | 58% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Node types, validation work. Undo/redo and serialization missing. |
| **C.2 Canvas & Rendering** | 83% | ‚úÖ Strong | Dragging, wires, preview excellent. Zoom/pan UI missing. |
| **C.3 Features** | 7% | ‚ùå Critical | Only validation panel partial. Search, history, shortcuts, import/export, copy/paste, metadata, onboarding ALL MISSING. |
| **C.4 Styling** | 80% | ‚úÖ Strong | Design tokens, animations, dark mode solid. Light mode toggle missing. |
| **OVERALL** | **57%** | **‚ö†Ô∏è MISALIGNED** | 3 of 4 pillars strong, but Feature pillar blocks deployment. |

## What Works ‚úÖ

1. **Visual Design**: Glass-morphism UI, cohesive styling, professional look
2. **Architecture**: React context, proper component hierarchy, state management
3. **Canvas Core**: Node dragging (grid-snapped), Bezier wires, LED preview (144√ó1)
4. **Performance**: 60 FPS capable, no blocking renders
5. **Accessibility (Partial)**: Icons, color contrast, hover states present

## What's Broken ‚ùå (Critical Blockers)

| Feature | Impact | Why Blocked |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| **Node Search** | Can't add nodes to canvas | No palette/discovery UI |
| **Undo/Redo** | No workflow recovery | No history stack implemented |
| **Import/Export** | No data persistence | No serialization UI or logic |
| **Keyboard Shortcuts** | Poor power-user UX | No keyboard event handlers |
| **Copy/Paste** | Can't duplicate nodes/subgraphs | No copy logic or paste UI |
| **Metadata Editor** | Can't document graphs/nodes | No metadata UI |
| **Onboarding** | New users confused | No welcome modal or tutorial |
| **Wire Creation** | Can't manually draw connections | No interactive wire drawing |

## Gap Details: By Pillar

### C.1: Infrastructure (58% - Partial)

**Working**:
- ‚úÖ Node types (8 variants: BEAT, SPECTRUM, AUDIO GAIN, TIME PULSE, POSITION, MULTIPLY, COLOR MIX, PALETTE, OUTPUT)
- ‚úÖ Port system (Scalar, Field, Color types with visual indicators)
- ‚úÖ Graph validation (DAG check, type matching, semantic error list)
- ‚úÖ Cost tracking (Light/Heavy nodes for performance budgeting)

**Missing**:
- ‚ùå Undo/redo stack
- ‚ùå Graph serialization (no JSON schema, import/export UI)
- ‚ùå Persistent store (currently in-memory only, no localStorage/file sync)

### C.2: Canvas & Rendering (83% - Strong)

**Working**:
- ‚úÖ Node dragging with grid snapping
- ‚úÖ Bezier wire rendering with type colors
- ‚úÖ LED preview (144√ó1 live update with play/pause)
- ‚úÖ 60 FPS capable (Vite + React 18 + Framer Motion)
- ‚úÖ 9-node graph shown as proof-of-concept

**Missing**:
- ‚ùå Interactive wire creation (no drag-from-port UI)
- ‚ùå Zoom/pan controls in toolbar (context exists, UI doesn't)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Unknown: Performance with 50+ nodes (untested at scale)

### C.3: Features (7% - Critical Failure)

**Partially Working**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Validation details panel (shows errors but no drill-down, severity, or remediation)

**All Missing**:
- ‚ùå Node search / palette discovery
- ‚ùå Undo/redo UI (no buttons, no shortcuts)
- ‚ùå Keyboard shortcuts (no Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+C/V, Ctrl+D, etc.)
- ‚ùå Import/export UI (no file picker, no download button)
- ‚ùå Copy/paste (no copy button, no paste logic)
- ‚ùå Metadata editor (no graph title/author, no per-node comments)
- ‚ùå Onboarding (no welcome modal, no tutorial, empty state unclear)

### C.4: Styling (80% - Strong)

**Working**:
- ‚úÖ Design tokens fully applied (Bebas/Rama/JetBrains fonts, color palette, glass effects)
- ‚úÖ Animations smooth and performant (Framer Motion, 60 FPS)
- ‚úÖ Dark mode complete (no light mode toggle, but CSS-ready)
- ‚úÖ Icon library (10+ icons from Lucide React)

**Missing**:
- ‚ùå Light mode toggle button
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 5+ icons needed for new features (search, undo/redo, delete, etc.)
- ‚ùå Onboarding UI (no tutorial styling)

---

## Alignment vs. Phase C Requirements

### ‚úÖ ALIGNED

- **Canvas rendering**: Achieves target (60 FPS, dragging, wires, preview)
- **Design system**: Exceeds target (professional glass-morphism, consistent tokens)
- **Component architecture**: Exceeds target (clean hierarchy, state management)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY ALIGNED

- **Validation**: Partial (panel exists but lacks detail, drill-down, remediation)
- **Infrastructure**: Partial (validation works, but undo/redo and serialization missing)
- **Zoom/pan**: Partial (implementation in place, UI missing)

### ‚ùå NOT ALIGNED

- **Features**: 7 critical features missing (search, undo, shortcuts, import/export, copy/paste, metadata, onboarding)
- **Data persistence**: No serialization or file I/O
- **Keyboard navigation**: No keyboard event handlers
- **Empty state UX**: Not demonstrated

---

## Phase C Deployment Readiness

### Current Readiness: 57/100 ‚ùå BLOCKED

**Go/No-Go Decision**: **NO-GO** üõë

**Reason**: Feature pillar (C.3) at 7% completion. Users cannot:
1. Discover nodes to add
2. Save/load graphs
3. Use power-user shortcuts
4. Recover from mistakes (no undo)
5. Document their work (no metadata)

These are **table-stakes** for a node editor.

## Recommended Fix Timeline

| Week | Focus | Effort | Status |
|------|-------|--------|--------|
| **1** | Critical features (search, undo, import/export) | 6-8 days | **MUST HAVE** |
| **2** | Usability (shortcuts, wire creation, validation detail) | 5-6 days | **MUST HAVE** |
| **3** | Polish (zoom/pan, onboarding, light mode) | 6-8 days | **NICE TO HAVE** |
| **4** | Testing, accessibility audit, optimization | 5-6 days | **NICE TO HAVE** |
| **TOTAL** | | **22-28 days** | **~4 weeks** |

**Earliest Phase C deployment**: **4 weeks from start** (assuming dedicated team)

## Quick Checklist: What Needs to Be Added

### CRITICAL (Blocks deployment)
- [ ] Node search/palette UI
- [ ] Undo/redo buttons + history stack
- [ ] Import/export buttons + serialization
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+C/V, Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+D, Escape, F)
- [ ] Copy/paste logic

### HIGH (Required for usability)
- [ ] Wire creation UI (drag from port)
- [ ] Metadata editor (graph title/author, per-node comments)
- [ ] Error drill-down in validation panel
- [ ] Onboarding (welcome modal, sample templates)

### MEDIUM (Polish)
- [ ] Zoom/pan controls
- [ ] Light mode toggle
- [ ] Large graph optimization
- [ ] Grid line snapping visualization

---

## Verdict

**Alignment**: 57% overall, but **misaligned on critical features** (C.3).

**Recommendation**:
- ‚úÖ Use existing UI/canvas/styling foundation (excellent work)
- ‚ùå **STOP deployment preparation**
- üîß **IMMEDIATELY START** on Week 1 critical features
- üìÖ **Reschedule** Phase C deployment to ~4 weeks from now
- üìä **Create** a feature completion dashboard to track progress

The wireframe is **70% correct on visual design and 80% correct on architecture**, but **0% useful to end users** without the missing features. Focus on features first, polish second.
