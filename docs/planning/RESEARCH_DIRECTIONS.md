# K1.reinvented Research Directions

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive technical analysis, the K1.reinvented system has proven its core thesis: **artistic vision can be compiled to native code without compromise**. The performance goal for Phase A is a targeted ~120 FPS (with an absolute floor of 100 FPS), and research should align to that envelope while expanding creative possibilities.

**Current State:** System compiles and runs. The architecture is sound; implementation should focus on consistent ~120 FPS and avoiding drops below 100 FPS under supported LED counts.

## Critical Research Questions

### 1. Performance Envelope: Sustaining ~120 FPS (>=100 FPS)

**Current Bottleneck:** RMT driver operates without DMA, causing CPU blocking during LED transmission. Maximum theoretical FPS is ~180.

**Research Questions:**
1. **Protocol Selection:** Should we migrate from RMT to I2S+DMA or SPI+DMA for WS2812B control?
   - I2S can achieve 8x parallel output with DMA
   - SPI requires bit-packing but offers flexible timing
   - What protocol is optimal at target LED counts for ~120 FPS with headroom?

2. **Double Buffering Architecture:** How do we implement zero-copy double buffering?
   - Render to buffer A while transmitting buffer B
   - Atomic buffer swaps without memory copies
   - How to handle partial frame updates?

3. **DMA Configuration:** What are the optimal DMA settings for LED output?
   - Circular vs linear buffers
   - Descriptor chaining for continuous output
   - Interrupt frequency vs CPU overhead

**Research Deliverable:** Benchmarked comparison of RMT vs I2S vs SPI at supported LED counts, with working code examples sustaining ~120 FPS (no drops below 100 FPS).

### 2. Dual-Core Architecture: Parallel Processing

**Current State:** Single-core execution, wasting 50% of ESP32-S3's compute capacity.

**Research Questions:**
1. **Core Allocation Strategy:** What's the optimal task distribution?
   - Core 0: Audio processing, network, OTA updates?
   - Core 1: LED rendering, effect computation?
   - How to minimize cache thrashing between cores?

2. **Synchronization Primitives:** How to share data without blocking?
   - Lock-free ring buffers for audio features
   - Atomic operations for parameter updates
   - Memory barriers and cache coherency

3. **RTOS Task Design:** FreeRTOS task priorities and stack sizes?
   - What priority levels prevent audio dropouts?
   - How much stack for FFT computation?
   - Task notification vs queues vs semaphores?

**Research Deliverable:** Dual-core architecture with measured performance, zero frame drops below 100 FPS, sustaining ~120 FPS with audio processing.

### 3. Node Graph Evolution: Expressive Power

**Current Limitation:** Only 5 node types (position_gradient, palette_interpolate, gradient, hsv_to_rgb, output). This limits artistic expression.

**Research Questions:**
1. **Temporal Animation Nodes:** How to add time-based effects while maintaining compilation?
   - Sine/cosine wave generators
   - Sawtooth/triangle oscillators
   - Perlin noise generators
   - Should time be a compile-time constant or runtime variable?

2. **Mathematical Operation Nodes:** What math nodes enable complex effects?
   - Add, multiply, modulate, clamp, smooth
   - How to optimize floating-point operations?
   - SIMD vectorization opportunities on ESP32-S3?

3. **Spatial Effect Nodes:** How to create position-aware patterns?
   - Radial gradients from arbitrary centers
   - Wave propagation with configurable speed
   - Particle systems with physics simulation
   - Can we compile physics to avoid runtime computation?

4. **Compositing and Layering:** How to blend multiple effects?
   - Alpha blending between layers
   - Masking and clipping regions
   - Crossfading between patterns
   - Memory overhead of multiple buffers?

**Research Deliverable:** Extended node library with 20+ node types, example graphs showing creative possibilities, and performance measurements.

### 4. Audio-Reactive Architecture: Synchronized Beauty

**Vision:** Light that responds to music with intentionality, not generic visualization.

**Research Questions:**
1. **Audio Input Hardware:** I2S MEMS vs analog ADC?
   - INMP441 (I2S, 64dB SNR) vs MAX9814 (analog, 40dB SNR)
   - Latency differences between digital and analog paths
   - Power consumption and noise floor comparison

2. **DSP Pipeline Design:** What's the optimal FFT configuration?
   - FFT size: 256 vs 512 vs 1024 samples
   - Window functions: Hann vs Hamming vs Blackman
   - Overlap percentage for smooth feature extraction
   - Can we use ESP32-S3's vector instructions for FFT?

3. **Beat Detection Algorithms:** How to reliably detect musical beats?
   - Energy-based vs spectral flux methods
   - Adaptive thresholding for varying music genres
   - Multi-band beat detection (bass vs snare)
   - Machine learning approaches (feasible on ESP32-S3?)

4. **Audio-to-Visual Mapping:** How to maintain intentionality?
   - Compiled mappings vs runtime interpretation
   - Audio features as node inputs vs modulation sources
   - Synchronization between ~86Hz audio and ~120Hz visual
   - How to avoid generic "music visualizer" aesthetics?

**Research Deliverable:** Complete audio subsystem design with <35ms latency, proven beat detection across genres, and example audio-reactive patterns that maintain artistic intentionality.

### 5. Scalability and Limits: How Far Can We Push?

**Current Configuration:** 180 LEDs, single strip, 939KB firmware.

**Research Questions:**
1. **Maximum LED Count:** What's the theoretical limit?
   - At what point does memory become constrained?
   - How many LEDs before FPS drops below 100?
   - Multi-strip parallel output feasibility?

2. **Network Control Protocol:** How to add real-time control without compromising FPS?
   - WebSocket vs OSC vs custom UDP protocol
   - Latency requirements for live performance
   - Parameter update frequency vs visual smoothness
   - WiFi coexistence with LED timing

3. **Pattern Complexity Limits:** How complex can node graphs be?
   - Maximum nodes before compilation fails
   - Runtime performance vs graph complexity
   - Memory usage per node type
   - Can we implement graph optimization passes?

4. **Hardware Variations:** ESP32-S3 vs ESP32-P4 vs RP2040?
   - Performance comparison at same workload
   - Power consumption differences
   - Cost-benefit analysis
   - Migration complexity

**Research Deliverable:** Scalability matrix showing performance at various LED counts (180, 360, 720, 1440), network protocols benchmarked, and hardware platform comparison.
