## What Problem Does Phase C Solve?

### Current State (Post-Phase B)
- ✅ Node graph system fully functional
- ✅ JSON format proven and validated
- ✅ Codegen pipeline compiles to C++ successfully
- ✅ 16 Phase B node types defined and working
- ❌ **BUT**: No visual editor (JSON-only)

### Pain Points for Pattern Designers
1. **Manual JSON editing** - Error-prone, requires deep understanding
2. **No visual representation** - Hard to understand data flow
3. **No real-time preview** - Can't see results before compilation
4. **High barrier to entry** - Technical users only
5. **Slow iteration** - Compile after each change

### What Phase C Enables

**Visual Node Editor**:
- Drag-drop node creation (intuitive)
- Visual wires showing data flow (clarity)
- Real-time preview at 30+ FPS (instant feedback)
- Parameter editing with type-specific controls (user-friendly)
- Pattern save/load/export (workflow integration)

**Educational Value**:
- Users learn graph concepts visually
- Color-coded nodes teach categories
- Wire connections teach data flow
- Error messages teach validation rules

**Expanded User Base**:
- Non-technical users can design patterns
- Faster iteration enables more experimentation
- Beautiful results without deep knowledge

---

## Architecture: The "Why" Behind Design Choices

### Core Decisions

**1. React Context + Canvas/SVG (Not Three.js)**
- **Why**: Lightweight, performant, familiar pattern in K1
- **Alternative rejected**: Three.js too heavy, unnecessary complexity
- **Result**: 60 FPS canvas performance maintained

**2. CPU-Based LED Simulation (Not GPU)**
- **Why**: 1D LED array doesn't need GPU, CPU is simple
- **Alternative rejected**: WebGL adds complexity without benefit
- **Result**: 30+ FPS preview, debuggable rendering

**3. Real-Time Validation (Prevent Invalid Graphs)**
- **Why**: Users should never create unpublishable patterns
- **Alternative rejected**: Validate on export (creates frustration)
- **Result**: Educational, prevents errors early

**4. Auto-Save Every 30 Seconds**
- **Why**: Users don't lose work, reasonable auto-save cadence
- **Alternative rejected**: Every keystroke (disk thrashing), never save (data loss)
- **Result**: Balance responsiveness with resource usage

### Philosophy Alignment

Every architectural decision honors K1's core principles:

**Intentionality**:
- Color coding teaches node categories intentionally
- Parameter editors are type-specific (no generic inputs)
- UI never suggests mediocre choices

**Minimalism**:
- 1,200-1,500 lines of code total
- Essential features only
- No decorative animations or bloat

**Clarity**:
- Visual graph language obvious to users
- Bezier curves show data flow direction
- Error messages explain and guide

**Performance**:
- 60 FPS canvas guaranteed
- 30 FPS preview minimum
- No compromise on speed

## Implementation Phases: What Gets Built When

### Phase C.1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
**Deliverable**: Functional editor with node creation and parameter editing

```
✅ Can create nodes by dragging from palette
✅ Can position nodes on canvas with snap-to-grid
✅ Can edit parameters per node
✅ Can see node types color-coded
✅ Undo/redo works for all operations
```

**Files**: 10-12 new files, 500-600 lines of code

---

### Phase C.2: Interactivity (Week 3)
**Deliverable**: Wire drawing and validation working

```
✅ Can create wires between node ports
✅ Validation prevents invalid connections
✅ Error messages explain validation failures
✅ Red outlines show invalid nodes
✅ Undo/redo for all operations
```

**Files**: 5-6 new files, 400-500 lines of code

---

### Phase C.3: Preview System (Week 4)
**Deliverable**: Real-time preview and export

```
✅ Canvas shows simulated LED strip
✅ Pattern renders in real-time at 30+ FPS
✅ Play/pause/speed controls work
✅ Can export pattern as JSON
✅ Exported JSON validates against codegen
```

**Files**: 5-6 new files, 500-600 lines of code

---

### Phase C.4: Polish (Week 5)
**Deliverable**: Production-ready with complete documentation

```
✅ Keyboard shortcuts working (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+S, etc.)
✅ Help system with tutorials
✅ Pattern save/load from library
✅ UI polished and accessible (WCAG AA)
✅ Complete documentation written
✅ 75%+ test coverage achieved
```

**Files**: 8-10 new files, 300-400 lines of code

---

## Technical Integration Points

### Integration with K1Provider

**New State Added**:
```typescript
K1ProviderState {
  patternDesigner?: {
    currentGraph: GraphState;
    savedPatterns: { id: string; graph: GraphState }[];
    isDesigning: boolean;
  };
}
```

**New Actions**:
```
actions.startPatternDesign(graphId?: string)
actions.savePatternDesign(name: string)
actions.exportPatternAsJSON()
actions.loadPatternIntoDesigner(patternId: string)
```

**No Breaking Changes**: Existing K1Provider functionality unchanged

---

### Integration with Codegen

**Compilation Pipeline**:
```
GraphState (TypeScript)
    ↓ (NodeEditorService.toJSON)
PatternJSON (compatible with codegen)
    ↓ (nodeEditorService.validate)
ValidationResult
    ↓ (if valid)
Export to file
    ↓ (user action)
Compile with existing pipeline
```

**No Codegen Changes Required**: Exports match existing JSON format

---

### UI Integration in Control App

**Navigation Addition**:
```
Sidebar (updated):
├── Control Panel (existing)
├── Debug View (existing)
├── Pattern Designer (NEW)  ← Opens node editor
├── Pattern Library (NEW)   ← Browse patterns
└── Settings
```

**Entry Points**:
- "Design new pattern" → Opens blank editor
- "Edit existing pattern" → Opens with pattern loaded
- "Browse patterns" → Pattern library modal

---

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| Canvas not 60 FPS | Medium | Early profiling, render optimization |
| Preview ≠ firmware | Medium | Side-by-side comparison tests |
| Scope creep | High | Strict scope, cut Phase D features |
| Type complexity | Medium | Clear types upfront, validation |
| Performance regression | Low | Continuous profiling during dev |

### Safety Net Strategy

1. **Performance Gates** (non-negotiable):
   - Canvas must maintain 60 FPS
   - Preview must achieve 30+ FPS
   - Memory usage must stay <100MB

2. **Quality Gates** (non-negotiable):
   - TypeScript: 0 errors
   - Test coverage: >75%
   - WCAG AA accessibility
   - Zero known bugs

3. **Scope Gates** (prevent bloat):
   - No feature unless it serves mission
   - Code review for each PR
   - Regular architecture review
