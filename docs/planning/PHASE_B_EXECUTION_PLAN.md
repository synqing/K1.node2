# K1 Phase B Execution Plan

This plan defines objectives, deliverables, timeline, resources, task ownership, review cadence, success metrics, and contingencies to execute the wireless system enhancement and related infrastructure improvements.

## Objectives & Deliverables

- Implement Wi-Fi enhancements end-to-end (firmware, network, dashboard, testing) with measurable performance and reliability gains.
- Integrate AdvancedWiFiManager, NetworkSecurityModule, and NetworkAnalyticsEngine into firmware with configurable policies.
- Enable WPA3/802.1X readiness on target APs and validate seamless roaming and client steering under load.
- Upgrade the Emotiscope 2.0 dashboard with real-time network metrics and connection management UX.
- Establish a CI-driven wireless testing framework with throughput/latency/jitter, roaming, and security tests.
- Produce deployment runbooks and rollback procedures for lab and production environments.
- Deliver Phase B release artifacts: Firmware `vB.1` build, dashboard `v2` build, test reports, ops documentation.

## Timeline & Milestones (6 Weeks)

- Week 1 — Kickoff & Foundations
  - Finalize feature scope, policies, and test acceptance criteria.
  - Prepare test lab: AP configuration (WPA3/802.1X-ready), iperf3, monitoring.
  - Implement non-blocking "network pause" behavior before Wi-Fi disconnect.
  - Establish performance baseline and CI scaffolding.

- Week 2 — Core Firmware Integration
  - Integrate AdvancedWiFiManager hooks (roaming, client steering, retry/backoff).
  - Wire NetworkSecurityModule (MAC controls, rate limits, IDS hooks).
  - Basic metrics collection + debug endpoints.
  - Unit tests and initial device QA.

- Week 3 — UX & Roaming
  - Dashboard updates for connection management and real-time metrics.
  - Implement client steering and Fast BSS Transition (802.11r) pathways.
  - Roaming scenario tests and load validation.

- Week 4 — Analytics & CI
  - Integrate NetworkAnalyticsEngine, alert thresholds, and export.
  - Automate test suites in CI (throughput/latency, roaming, security, regression).
  - Staging rollout with monitoring and rollback.

- Week 5 — Hardening & Optimization
  - Performance tuning, bug fixes, and reliability improvements.
  - Security validation (WPA3/802.1X flows, rate limiting, IDS rules).
  - Documentation pass and operator training materials.

- Week 6 — Release & Review
  - Production rollout with guardrails and progressive exposure.
  - Post-implementation review, KPI assessment, and retrospective.

## Resources (Personnel, Tools, Budget)

- Personnel (roles & indicative allocation)
  - Project Manager (A): coordination, timeline, stakeholder updates — 0.5 FTE.
  - Firmware Engineer (R): integration, testing, performance tuning — 1.0 FTE.
  - Network Engineer (R/C): AP config, WPA3/802.1X, monitoring — 0.5–1.0 FTE.
  - Security Engineer (R/C): hardening, validation, incident playbooks — 0.5 FTE.
  - Frontend Engineer (R): dashboard updates, UX polish — 0.5 FTE.
  - QA Lead (R): test design, automation, execution — 0.5–1.0 FTE.
  - DevOps (C): CI, artifacts, environment orchestration — 0.25 FTE.

- Tools & Infrastructure
  - Firmware: PlatformIO, ESP-IDF, GitHub Actions CI.
  - Test & Monitoring: iperf3, Wireshark, Prometheus/Grafana, Playwright (dashboard), k6/Locust (optional load).
  - Network: Wi-Fi 6E/7 APs with WPA3/802.1X support, RADIUS (FreeRADIUS/Cloud), managed switches.

- Budget (high-level)
  - APs and networking gear upgrades and licenses.
  - Test equipment and SaaS monitoring (if applicable).
  - Training and documentation time.

## Progress Review Cadence

- Daily standup (15 min): blockers, priorities, handoffs.
- Weekly sprint review (60 min): demo, KPI trends, risks, next sprint.
- Bi-weekly leadership sync (30 min): milestone status, decisions.
- Async status updates: dashboard metrics and CI test board.

## Success Metrics & Evaluation

- Performance
  - Throughput: +40–70% over baseline under typical load.
  - Latency: median < 15 ms; jitter p95 < 5 ms.
  - Capacity: stable under 2× current concurrent sessions.

- Reliability & Roaming
  - Connection stability: > 99.5% over 24h soak.
  - Roaming handoff: < 100 ms with 802.11r-enabled paths.
  - Packet loss: < 0.5% under roaming + moderate load.

- Security
  - WPA3/802.1X readiness validated; zero critical vulnerabilities.
  - Rate limiting and IDS rules reduce abuse attempts by > 90%.

- UX & Ops
  - Dashboard: p95 load < 2.0 s; no-blocking controls.
  - CI test pass rate: > 95% stable for 2 weeks pre-release.

## Contingency Plans

- AP compatibility issues with WPA3/802.1X
  - Mitigation: enable mixed-mode, test alternative firmware, vendor support escalation, fallback to WPA2-Enterprise with compensating controls.

- Firmware integration regressions (crashes, performance dips)
  - Mitigation: feature flags, staged rollout, rollback scripts, targeted profiling, hotfix branch.

- Resource constraints or schedule slips
  - Mitigation: re-prioritize scope, add part-time support, extend sprints, adjust non-critical features.

- Test environment instability or flakiness
  - Mitigation: isolate tests, seed reproducibility, hardware health checks, retry policies, quarantine flaky tests.

- Security findings late in cycle
  - Mitigation: triage severity, hotfix criticals, defer low-risk issues, expand monitoring, incident runbooks.

## Risk Register (Top Items)

- Standards/feature mismatch between device and APs (Wi-Fi 7 readiness).
- Roaming performance varies by client chipset; ensure cross-client testing.
- Dashboard latency under load impacting operator actions; optimize UI updates.

## Communication Plan

- Central project board with milestones, owners, and burndown charts.
- Weekly summary reports with KPI snapshots and risk updates.
- Change logs for firmware and dashboard artifacts.

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- Availability of WPA3/802.1X-capable APs and RADIUS.
- Access to representative client devices (mobile, desktop, IoT chipsets).
- CI runners with network access to lab environment for tests.
