## Key Findings at a Glance

### Finding 1: All Use Blocking I2S Read
All four implementations call `i2s_channel_read()` with `portMAX_DELAY`. This blocks until data is available. However, it never actually blocks because hardware DMA continuously fills the buffers.

**Implication:** Standard pattern, safe in single-core, invisible in dual-core

### Finding 2: Single-Core Is Simpler & Safer
Sensory Bridge and K1.reinvented run everything in one thread. Audio and visual processing happen sequentially, so no synchronization is needed.

**Implication:** Best choice if CPU can keep up with rendering

### Finding 3: Dual-Core Enables Higher FPS
Emotiscope v1.2 and v2.0 run audio on Core 1 and GPU on Core 0 independently. This prevents render loop jitter but introduces possible frame drift.

**Implication:** Necessary only if single-core can't maintain desired FPS

### Finding 4: No Production Ring Buffers
Despite K1's documented design goal, no implementation actually uses a ring buffer. All use direct synchronous updates or history buffers.

**Implication:** Ring buffer is optimization, not requirement; sequential execution is correct

### Finding 5: Volatile Flags Replace Mutexes
Emotiscope versions use `volatile` flags instead of mutexes. This is safe because only one core writes (audio) and another reads (video).

**Implication:** Lock-free synchronization is possible but requires careful design

### Finding 6: End-to-End Latency Is Deterministic
Latency = (audio chunk duration) + (one visual frame time). No variable delays.

**Implication:** Predictable behavior makes debugging easier

### Finding 7: Only K1 Checks for I2S Errors
K1 includes error handling for I2S timeouts. Other implementations assume it always succeeds.

**Implication:** K1 is more robust; others may crash if microphone disconnects

### Finding 8: Loop Unrolling Reduces Overhead
Emotiscope versions call the main loop function 4× per iteration to reduce branch overhead.

**Implication:** Micro-optimization, ~2-3% benefit, trade-off with code size

### Finding 9: Downsampling Is Efficiency Strategy
Only ESv2.0 downsamples audio from 12.8 kHz to 6.4 kHz after acquisition.

**Implication:** Reduces Goertzel processing load, accepts lower frequency resolution

### Finding 10: Sample Rates Vary Strategically
- 16 kHz: Standard (Sensory Bridge, K1) - good compromise
- 25.6 kHz: Maximum (ESv1.2) - maximum frequency coverage
- 12.8 kHz: Minimal (ESv2.0) - lowest CPU cost

**Implication:** No one "best" choice; depends on use case

## Questions Answered

**Q: Why does every implementation use blocking I2S?**
A: ESP32 I2S driver has no non-blocking mode. Hardware DMA handles continuous buffering, so "blocking" call returns instantly.

**Q: Can single-core match dual-core FPS?**
A: Yes, if rendering is fast enough. Sensory Bridge targets 120+, K1 targets 200+ FPS in single-core mode.

**Q: Do I need a ring buffer?**
A: No. All working implementations use direct synchronous updates. Ring buffers are optimization, not requirement.

**Q: Why different sample rates?**
A: Trade-off between frequency resolution and CPU load. Higher rate = better detail, more processing.

**Q: How much latency is acceptable?**
A: All implementations have 8-20ms latency, which is imperceptible to humans for music visualization.

**Q: What's the best synchronization strategy?**
A: Depends on your constraints. See decision tree in `audio_sync_comparative_summary.txt` #11.
