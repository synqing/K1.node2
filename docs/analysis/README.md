### Performance & Architecture Forensics

**[FPS Regression Forensic Timeline](FPS_REGRESSION_FORENSIC_TIMELINE.md)** - **CODE ARCHAEOLOGY INVESTIGATION**
- **Length:** ~25,000 words, complete forensic timeline with exact commits
- **Date:** 2025-10-28
- **Impact:** Traced FPS regression from 150+ FPS → 42.5 FPS → RESTORED
- **Focus:** Git archaeology to find exact breaking commits and restore baseline performance

**Key Findings:**
- **Baseline (0c1fc43):** 150+ FPS with portMAX_DELAY I2S read, no throttles
- **Regression #1 (ad039d5):** I2S timeout changed portMAX_DELAY → 20ms timeout
- **Regression #2 (e962360):** Added 20ms main loop throttle (ironically labeled "avoid throttling render FPS")
- **Combined Effect:** Audio forced to 50 Hz, main loop blocked every 20ms = 42.5 FPS cap
- **Fix (13ab26f):** Removed throttle, restored portMAX_DELAY, fixed SAMPLE_RATE = 200+ FPS target

**Breaking Commits Identified:**
```
ad039d5 (2025-10-27 02:14:50) ❌ "chore(docs): sweep project root into taxonomy"
├── Hidden change: portMAX_DELAY → pdMS_TO_TICKS(20) in microphone.h
└── Impact: I2S hardware sync broken, timeout errors introduced

e962360 (2025-10-27 04:19:28) ❌ "Setup: Control Interface Revolution foundation"
├── Hidden change: audio_interval_ms = 20 throttle added to main loop
└── Impact: Audio forced to 50 Hz, blocked render pipeline every 20ms
```

**Mathematical Proof:**
- 20ms throttle = 50 Hz maximum audio rate
- Combined with I2S blocking variance = 23.5ms average frame time
- Result: 1000ms / 23.5ms = 42.5 FPS measured (matches empirical data)

**Restoration Strategy:**
- Removed artificial timing throttles from main loop
- Restored portMAX_DELAY in I2S microphone read (natural DMA pacing)
- Fixed SAMPLE_RATE mismatch (12800 Hz → 16000 Hz)
- Removed telemetry broadcast overhead
- Result: AP-VP contract restored, 200+ FPS target achievable

**Architecture Lessons:**
1. Trust hardware synchronization (I2S DMA pacing)
2. Artificial throttles defeat natural hardware cadence
3. "Optimization" comments can hide performance regressions
4. Breaking changes hidden in unrelated commits are forensic nightmares
5. Baseline architecture contracts must be preserved

## Quick Summary

### Current State
- **File:** `firmware/src/webserver.cpp`
- **Lines:** 1,621 total
- **Status:** Monolithic, mixed concerns

### Module Breakdown

| Module | Lines | % | Status |
|--------|-------|---|--------|
| Initialization & Setup | 1,290 | 79% | Monolith |
| Web UI Dashboard | 622 | 38% | **Embedded (EXTRACT)** |
| Rate Limiting | 72 | 4% | **Reusable (EXTRACT)** |
| JSON Builders | 76 | 5% | **Reusable (EXTRACT)** |
| Control Endpoints | 300 | 19% | Boilerplate (refactor) |
| Status Endpoints | 160 | 10% | Pattern-based (refactor) |
| WebSocket Handler | 84 | 5% | Testable (extract) |
| Error & CORS Utils | 24 | 2% | Small (extract) |
| Parameter Logic | 19 | 1% | Business logic (extract) |

### Top Issues

1. **38% of file is Web UI** (622 lines of HTML/CSS/JS embedded in C++)
   - Should be separate files (HTML, CSS, JS)
   - Can use standard web development tools
   - No C++ recompilation for UI changes

2. **55 lines of duplicate POST body handling code** (appears 5 times)
   - Lines 266-277, 315-326, 422-433, 517-527, 1371-1380
   - Extract to `ChunkedBodyAccumulator` utility class

3. **Rate limiting check pattern repeated 13x** (~65 lines of duplication)
   - Every endpoint has identical boilerplate
   - Extract to standardized `RateLimiter` class

4. **One endpoint registered twice** (GET /api/device/info)
   - Lines 237-262 and 1213-1239 are exact duplicates
   - Simple fix: remove one

5. **2 unused imports**
   - `#include "connection_state.h"` (line 10)
   - `#include "audio/goertzel.h"` (line 7)

### Recommended Extraction Order

**Phase 1 (Highest Impact, Lowest Risk):**
1. Extract Web UI to separate files → saves 622 lines, enables web tools
2. Extract Rate Limiter → makes code reusable, testable
3. Extract JSON Builders → unit testable responses

**Phase 2 (Moderate Effort):**
4. Extract ChunkedBodyAccumulator → eliminates 55 lines of duplication
5. Extract Parameter Validation → business logic separation
6. Extract HTTP Response Utils → CORS, error handling

**Phase 3 (Optional, Higher Effort):**
7. Extract Realtime Telemetry → decouple WebSocket
8. (Optional) Endpoint Base Class → standardize pattern

### Expected Outcome

- **From:** 1,621 lines in one file
- **To:** ~900 lines in webserver.cpp + 6-8 focused modules
- **Benefit:** Testable, maintainable, extensible architecture

---

## Key Findings

### Critical Seams (Easy to Extract)

1. **Web UI (Lines 585-1207, 622 lines)**
   - Risk: LOW
   - Effort: 2-3 hours
   - Move to: `/firmware/data/ui/` (index.html, css/style.css, js/app.js)
   - Benefit: HUGE (pure web tools, no C++ recompilation)

2. **Rate Limiter (Lines 35-106, 72 lines)**
   - Risk: LOW
   - Effort: 1-2 hours
   - Move to: `/firmware/src/webserver_rate_limiter.h/cpp`
   - Benefit: Reusable, unit testable

3. **JSON Builders (Lines 108-183, 76 lines)**
   - Risk: LOW
   - Effort: 2-3 hours
   - Move to: `/firmware/src/webserver_response_builders.h`
   - Benefit: Unit testable, reusable

### Architectural Patterns

**Status Endpoints (Read-Only):**
- All follow identical pattern: check rate limit → build JSON → attach CORS → send
- Could standardize with endpoint registry pattern

**Control Endpoints (Mutable):**
- All POST handlers duplicate body accumulation logic
- All parse JSON and apply domain changes
- Could use handler wrapper pattern

**Error Responses:**
- Standardized format but scattered implementation
- Could centralize in HTTP response utilities module

## Dependency Analysis

### External Libraries
- `AsyncWebServer` (HTTP framework)
- `AsyncWebSocket` (real-time updates)
- `ESPmDNS` (service discovery)
- `ArduinoJson` (JSON serialization)

### Internal Dependencies
- `parameters.h` — Parameter system & defaults
- `pattern_registry.h` — Pattern metadata & selection
- `palettes.h` — Color palette data
- `wifi_monitor.h` — WiFi configuration
- `profiler.h` — Performance metrics (FPS, timings)
- `cpu_monitor.h` — CPU usage tracking

### Unused Dependencies
- `connection_state.h` — Not referenced anywhere (safe to remove)
- `audio/goertzel.h` — Not referenced anywhere (safe to remove)

---

## Testing Strategy

### What to Test
- **Unit tests:** Rate limiter, JSON builders, parameter validation
- **Integration tests:** All endpoints with mock requests
- **Web tests:** UI with Jest/Cypress
- **Performance tests:** WebSocket broadcast latency

### What's Currently Untestable
- Individual endpoints (tightly coupled to AsyncWebServer)
- Rate limiting (logic buried in handler)
- JSON building (mixed with HTTP code)
- Parameter updates (mixed with endpoint logic)

### After Refactoring
- Unit test rate limiter independently
- Unit test JSON builders independently
- Unit test parameter validation independently
- Integration test endpoints with extracted components
- Standard web testing for UI (Jest, Cypress, etc.)

## Migration Strategy

### Week 1: UI Extraction (4-6 hours)
- [ ] Create `/firmware/data/ui/` directory
- [ ] Extract HTML, CSS, JavaScript to separate files
- [ ] Update build system for SPIFFS inclusion
- [ ] Test static file serving
- [ ] Verify zero behavioral regressions

**Result:** webserver.cpp reduced by 622 lines (38%)

### Week 2: Utility Extractions (4-6 hours)
- [ ] Create `webserver_rate_limiter.h/cpp`
- [ ] Create `webserver_response_builders.h`
- [ ] Create `http_response_utils.h`
- [ ] Update all endpoints to use utilities
- [ ] Add unit tests for new modules

**Result:** Reusable components, improved testability

### Week 3: Handler Standardization (4-6 hours)
- [ ] Create `async_request_handler.h` with ChunkedBodyAccumulator
- [ ] Refactor 5 POST endpoints to use it
- [ ] Create `parameter_validation.h`
- [ ] Integration test affected endpoints

**Result:** Eliminate 55 lines of duplication, cleaner code

### Week 4: Advanced (Optional, 4-6 hours)
- [ ] Create `realtime_telemetry.h/cpp`
- [ ] Decouple WebSocket from telemetry collection
- [ ] (Optional) Create `rest_endpoint.h` base class
- [ ] Refactor remaining endpoints if using base class

**Result:** Fully modular, testable, extensible

---

## Questions & Decisions

1. **SPIFFS Integration:** Is SPIFFS already configured in the build? If constrained, should UI be served from external CDN?

2. **Breaking Changes:** Do we need to maintain backward compatibility with any API clients?

3. **Testing Framework:** What test framework does the project use (Unity, Google Test, etc.)?

4. **Endpoint Standardization:** Should we introduce a `RestEndpoint` base class for standard pattern, or keep endpoints as lambdas?

5. **Priority:** Maximize impact (extract UI first) or minimize risk (extract utilities first)?
