# UART Daisy Chain Sync - Investigation Summary

## Key Finding: YES, THE SYSTEM IS RECEIVING PACKETS

The green status LED on S3Z indicates that **valid UART sync packets are being received and correctly parsed**. This is a definitive signal based on the state machine logic in the firmware.

### Evidence

1. **Green LED = `sync_valid == true`**
   - File: `/s3z/src/main.cpp` line 101
   - Green LED is only set when `status_state = STATUS_SYNCED`
   - `sync_valid` is only set in `parse_sync_packet()` after successful checksum validation

2. **Checksum must be correct**
   - XOR checksum validation happens before `sync_valid = true`
   - If checksum failed, LED would be red, not green
   - Therefore: Packet format and data integrity is correct

3. **Yellow→Green transition is meaningful**
   - Yellow = timeout state (>1 second without packets)
   - Green = active packet reception
   - Transition proves packets started arriving after timeout period

### Conclusion

**The UART daisy chain synchronization is functionally operational.**

## Architecture Summary

### Packet Flow

```
S3Main (Primary)                      S3Z (Secondary)
================                      ===============

setup():                              setup():
  init_uart_sync()                      init_uart_receiver()
  └─ UART1 @115200                      └─ UART1 @115200
     TX:GPIO38, RX:GPIO37                  RX:GPIO44, TX:GPIO43

loop() @ ~42 FPS:                     Core 1 Task (priority 15):
  watch_cpu_fps()                       uart_receive_task()
  └─ FRAMES_COUNTED++                   └─ byte-by-byte reception

  send_uart_sync_frame()              Loop:
  └─ Build 6-byte packet                update_status_led()
     [0xAA][FRAME_HI][FRAME_LO]         ├─ Check packets_received
     [PATTERN][BRIGHTNESS][CHECKSUM]    ├─ Check packets_invalid
  └─ uart_write_bytes()                 └─ Green LED ✓
     └─ Transmit to GPIO38
        (physically connected to GPIO44)
```

### Packet Format

```
Offset  Name        Description
------  ----        -----------
0       Sync Byte   0xAA (fixed marker)
1       Frame HI    (frame_counter >> 8) & 0xFF
2       Frame LO    frame_counter & 0xFF
3       Pattern ID  g_current_pattern_index
4       Brightness  (uint8_t)(params.brightness * 255)
5       Checksum    XOR of bytes 0-4

Total: 6 bytes
Rate: ~42 packets/second (synchronized to render FPS)
Baud: 115200 bps = 12 bytes/ms ≈ 0.5ms per packet
```

### Status LED States

| State | Color | Condition | Interpretation |
|-------|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| SYNCED | Green | `sync_valid == true` | Receiving and parsing packets ✓ |
| TIMEOUT | Yellow | `>1000ms without valid packet` | Lost connection |
| LISTENING | Blue | `sync_valid == false` AND `<1000ms` | Waiting for first packet |
| ERROR | Red | `packets_invalid > 0` | Checksum failures detected |
| BOOTING | Cyan | Initial state | Firmware starting up |

**Current Status:** S3Z Status LED is **GREEN** = **ACTIVELY SYNCED**

## What Green LED Proves

1. ✓ S3Main is transmitting UART packets (proven by successful reception)
2. ✓ Packets arrive at S3Z via GPIO 38→44 connection (proven by reception)
3. ✓ Packet format is correct (proven by sync byte and checksum validation)
4. ✓ Baud rate is correct (proven by successful byte alignment)
5. ✓ UART initialization works on both devices (proven by frame reception)

## What We Still Need to Verify

### 1. Packet Reception Rate
**Question:** How many packets/second is S3Z actually receiving?

**Expected:** ~42 packets/second (matches S3Main FPS)

**Why it matters:** Determines if sync is continuous or intermittent

**How to check:** Watch `packets_received` counter increment in real-time debug output

### 2. Error Rate
**Question:** How many invalid (checksum failure) packets?

**Expected:** packets_invalid = 0

**Why it matters:** Indicates signal integrity; >0 means data corruption

**How to check:** Serial output shows "Invalid=X" counter

### 3. Stability
**Question:** Does sync stay green, or does LED flicker between green and yellow?

**Expected:** Solid green with fast flashing (one flash per packet)

**Why it matters:** Green LED means at least one valid packet in last 1000ms; we need continuous reception

**How to check:** Visual observation of LED for 5+ minutes

### 4. Actual Sync Data Quality
**Question:** Are the sync_frame/sync_pattern/sync_brightness values correct?

**Expected:** sync_frame should match S3Main FPS, pattern should change when pattern switches, brightness should match UI slider

**Why it matters:** Proves data is being used, not just received

**How to check:** Render patterns and verify they behave synchronized with S3Main

## Instrumentation Added (2025-10-28)

To answer the above questions, debug output has been added:

### S3Main (`/firmware/src/main.cpp` lines 119-125)
```cpp
// Every 200 packets (~4.7 seconds at 42 FPS):
Serial.printf("UART: Sent %lu packets (frame %lu, last write %d bytes)\n",
    packets_sent, current_frame, bytes_written);
```

**Shows:**
- Total packets sent
- Current frame counter
- Last uart_write_bytes() return value (should be 6)

### S3Z (`/s3z/src/main.cpp` lines 469-483)
```cpp
// Every second:
Serial.printf("UART: RX=%lu packets, Invalid=%lu, State=%s, sync_valid=%d\n",
    packets_received, packets_invalid, state_name, sync_valid);
```

**Shows:**
- Total packets received
- Total invalid packets (checksum errors)
- Current LED state (human-readable)
- sync_valid flag

## Expected Behavior (with instrumentation)

### S3Main Serial Output
```
[boot messages...]
Ready!

FPS: 42.8
avg_ms render/quantize/wait/tx: 0.45 / 0.00 / 1.20 / 0.00

[~4.7 seconds later]
UART: Sent 200 packets (frame 200, last write 6 bytes)

[~4.7 seconds later]
UART: Sent 400 packets (frame 400, last write 6 bytes)
```

### S3Z Serial Output
```
[boot messages...]
============================================
✓ S3Z FIRMWARE READY
Waiting for sync packets from primary...
============================================

[~1 second later]
UART: RX=42 packets, Invalid=0, State=SYNCED(GREEN), sync_valid=1

[~1 second later]
UART: RX=85 packets, Invalid=0, State=SYNCED(GREEN), sync_valid=1

[~1 second later]
UART: RX=127 packets, Invalid=0, State=SYNCED(GREEN), sync_valid=1
```

**Interpretation:**
- `RX=42/second` matches expected ~42 FPS from S3Main
- `Invalid=0` means no checksum errors
- `State=SYNCED(GREEN)` confirms LED state
- Counters incrementing continuously means stable sync

## Root Cause Analysis

### If Everything Works (Most Likely)
The system is simply **working correctly**. No fix needed.

### If No Packets Received (RX=0)
**Root cause categories:**

1. **S3Main not transmitting**
   - No "Sent" messages on S3Main console
   - Check: uart_write_bytes() return value
   - Check: FRAMES_COUNTED incrementing
   - Check: UART initialization succeeded

2. **S3Z not receiving**
   - "Sent" messages on S3Main, but RX=0 on S3Z
   - Check: GPIO 38→44 wire connection
   - Check: Baud rate correct (115200)
   - Check: uart_read_bytes() timeout not too short

3. **Physical wiring broken**
   - Both devices initialized, but no data flow
   - Check: Wire connected firmly
   - Check: No shorts or open circuits
   - Check: Correct GPIO pins

### If Intermittent (RX increases then stops)
**Root cause:** Intermittent connection

1. **Loose wire connection**
   - LED flickers green→yellow
   - packets_received increases in bursts then stops
   - Fix: Reseat UART wires firmly

2. **High noise environment**
   - Occasional checksum errors
   - packets_invalid > 0
   - Fix: Use shielded twisted pair, move away from RF sources

## Verification Procedure

See `/Implementation.plans/runbooks/UART_SYNC_VERIFICATION_RUNBOOK.md` for complete step-by-step procedure including:

1. Building and uploading firmware with instrumentation
2. Running serial monitors on both devices
3. Interpreting output and LED behavior
4. Troubleshooting specific failure modes
5. Success criteria checklist

## Quick Status Check

**Right now, this moment:**

1. **Is S3Z receiving packets?** YES (green LED confirms)
2. **Is packet format correct?** YES (checksum validated, LED green)
3. **Is UART working?** YES (confirmed by functioning reception)
4. **Are there problems?** UNKNOWN - need instrumentation output to be certain

## Next Steps

1. **Compile** both firmware with instrumentation
2. **Upload** to both devices
3. **Run** serial monitors on both devices
4. **Observe** output for 30+ seconds
5. **Interpret** results using troubleshooting guide
6. **Fix** any issues identified, or confirm system is working

## Files Modified

- `/firmware/src/main.cpp` - Added UART transmission debug output
- `/s3z/src/main.cpp` - Added UART reception debug output

## Files Created

- `/docs/analysis/UART_DAISY_CHAIN_DIAGNOSTIC.md` - Technical deep-dive
- `/Implementation.plans/runbooks/UART_SYNC_VERIFICATION_RUNBOOK.md` - Verification procedure
- `/docs/analysis/UART_SYNC_INVESTIGATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## Conclusion

The UART daisy chain sync implementation is **architecturally sound and functionally demonstrating packet reception**. The green LED proves the system can receive and validate packets. With the added instrumentation, we can now definitively determine:

1. The actual packet reception rate
2. Whether sync is stable or intermittent
3. The root cause of any remaining issues

The next phase is to run the verification procedure and interpret the instrumentation output to confirm or diagnose the system's operational status.
