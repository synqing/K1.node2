# FPS Bottleneck Analysis - Complete Documentation Index

## Overview

This directory contains a complete forensic analysis of why K1.reinvented is capped at 43 FPS despite removing the 20ms audio throttle. The analysis includes exact code references, timing calculations, and mathematical proofs.

**Key Finding:** The I2S microphone timeout is misconfigured (20ms timeout on 8ms data chunks), creating unnecessary blocking that prevents higher FPS.

---

## Documents in This Analysis

### 1. **fps_bottleneck_i2s_timeout_forensic_analysis.md** (START HERE)
**Purpose:** Complete forensic proof of the I2S timeout bottleneck

**Contains:**
- Evidence gathering with exact code locations
- Deep dive analysis of audio pipeline timing
- Root cause chain (why FPS = 43)
- Configuration mismatch analysis (current vs. Emotiscope)
- Timing calculations and mathematical proof
- Risk assessment and recommendations

**Key Evidence:**
- Current timeout: `pdMS_TO_TICKS(20)` at microphone.h:93
- Data arrival: 8ms (128 samples / 16000 Hz)
- Timeout overhead: 12ms wasted per frame
- Loop cycle time: 23.3ms = 43 FPS
- Solution: Change timeout to 10ms = 5-minute fix

**Best for:** Understanding WHAT the problem is and WHY it exists

---

### 2. **fps_bottleneck_prioritized_fixes.md**
**Purpose:** Prioritized bottleneck matrix with severity/effort/impact scores

**Contains:**
- 4 identified bottlenecks (not just the timeout!)
- Prioritization matrix (ROI scoring)
- Multiple fix options for each bottleneck
- Effort estimates and risk assessments
- Execution path (phases 1-4)
- FPS projection curve

**Key Metrics:**
| Fix | Severity | Effort | Impact | Priority |
|-----|----------|--------|--------|----------|
| I2S timeout | 9/10 | 2/10 | +8-12% | **1 - NOW** |
| Ring buffer stub | 7/10 | 6/10 | +5-15% | 2 - NEXT |
| Goertzel every frame | 6/10 | 5/10 | +5-10% | 3 - LATER |
| WiFi on Core 0 | 4/10 | 3/10 | +0-2% | 4 - DEFER |

**Best for:** Understanding WHAT to fix FIRST and estimated impact

---

### 3. **fps_bottleneck_root_cause_chain.md**
**Purpose:** Trace FPS cap back to architectural decisions and implementation history

**Contains:**
- Symptom-to-root-cause traceback (9 levels deep)
- Why user expected different behavior
- Mathematical proof of root cause
- Verification against Emotiscope version
- Explanation of configuration changes
- Final root cause statement

**Key Chain:**
```
FPS=43 → Loop takes 23.3ms → Audio takes 23.1ms →
I2S+Goertzel bottleneck → I2S timeout mismatch (20ms for 8ms data) →
Configuration changed but timeout wasn't updated
```

**Best for:** Understanding WHY the mistake happened and WHEN it was introduced

---

## Quick Summary

### The Problem
FPS is capped at 43 because:
1. Main loop takes 23.3ms per frame
2. Audio pipeline takes 23.1ms (rendering only 0.09ms)
3. I2S read blocks 8-20ms (avg 14ms) due to timeout mismatch
4. Goertzel FFT takes 10-15ms per frame
5. Combined: 14ms + 15ms = 29ms → frame time ~23.3ms → 43 FPS

### The Root Cause
I2S timeout was set to 20ms for Emotiscope (5ms chunks) but never updated when configuration changed to 8ms chunks. This creates 6-8ms of unnecessary overhead per frame.

### The Fix
1. **Quick fix (5 min):** Change `pdMS_TO_TICKS(20)` to `pdMS_TO_TICKS(10)` → 43 → 45-46 FPS
2. **Medium fix (1 hour):** Implement ring buffer frame skipping → 45 → 47-49 FPS
3. **Long fix (4-6 hours):** Move Goertzel to Core 1 → 47 → 70-100+ FPS

### Risk Assessment
- I2S timeout fix: **MINIMAL RISK** (just reduces waiting time)
- Ring buffer implementation: **LOW RISK** (conservative timing)
- Core 1 audio task: **MEDIUM RISK** (threading complexity)

## Verification Checklist

Before implementing any fix, verify these findings:

- [ ] Read microphone.h line 93: Confirm `pdMS_TO_TICKS(20)` exists
- [ ] Calculate chunk time: 128 / 16000 = 0.008s = 8ms ✓
- [ ] Check FPS measurement: Loop cycle = 1000 / 43 = 23.3ms ✓
- [ ] Confirm render time: 0.09ms measured ✓
- [ ] Verify main loop: Audio called every iteration (no condition) ✓
- [ ] Check git history: When was sample rate/chunk size changed?
- [ ] Review Emotiscope commit: What was original timeout value?

All verifications should PASS before proceeding with fixes.

## Questions Answered

**Q: Why is FPS 43 and not higher?**
A: I2S timeout is misconfigured (20ms for 8ms data), adding 6-8ms overhead per frame. Combined with Goertzel (15ms), this consumes the entire 23.3ms frame budget.

**Q: Why didn't removing the throttle help?**
A: The main loop throttle was removed, but the I2S timeout (different 20ms value) still blocks every frame.

**Q: What's the quickest fix?**
A: Change `pdMS_TO_TICKS(20)` to `pdMS_TO_TICKS(10)` in microphone.h line 93. Takes 5 minutes, improves to 45-46 FPS.

**Q: What's the long-term solution?**
A: Move Goertzel and audio processing to Core 1, allowing rendering to run at full speed (70-100+ FPS) on Core 0.

**Q: Is this a bug or a design issue?**
A: Both. The timeout value (20ms) is a misunderstanding of the data cadence (8ms). The architecture (single-core) is a design limitation. Addressing the timeout fixes the first problem; addressing the architecture fixes the second.
