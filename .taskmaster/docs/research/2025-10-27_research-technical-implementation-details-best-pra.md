# Research Session

## Initial Query

**Question:** Research technical implementation details, best practices, and industry standards for Multi-Device Orchestration (PF-4), AI-Powered Creative Features (PF-5), Advanced Visualization and AR/VR (PF-6), and Enterprise Management and Security (PF-7) features for a lighting control application

**Response:**

**Scope And Goal**

- This summarizes technical approaches, best practices, and standards for PF-4 Multi‑Device Orchestration, PF-5 AI‑Powered Creative Features, PF-6 Advanced Visualization/AR‑VR, and PF-7 Enterprise Management/Security for a lighting control app.
- Recommendations align with a React/TypeScript + Vite control app, a K1 device accessed via WebSocket/REST, and current tasks (provider, discovery, error handling, docs/tests).

**PF‑4 Multi‑Device Orchestration**

- Architecture choices: Prefer an authoritative orchestrator (the control app or a small service) that maintains canonical scene state and device membership; devices apply idempotent commands. Use CRDTs only if you need offline edits/merges; otherwise keep a single source of truth with optimistic UI and server reconciliation.
- Discovery and grouping: Use mDNS/Bonjour for LAN discovery (service type e.g., `_k1._tcp`), with SSDP as fallback. Maintain a registry of `DeviceDescriptor` records and logical groups/scenes. Track `lastSeen`, firmware, capabilities, and coordinate system for visualization.
- Timebase and sync: Provide a `TimebaseService` backed by NTP/PTP (PTP for sub‑ms sync where hardware allows); fall back to local monotonic time with skew correction. For music/show control, support SMPTE/MTC, Ableton Link, or OSC clock. All cues reference timecode rather than “play now.”
- Messaging layer: For K1 today, use WebSocket for control frames (small, idempotent JSON commands) and optionally UDP multicast for bulk streaming if/when devices support sACN (ANSI E1.31). For cloud/fleet, consider MQTT with retained scene topics per group and QoS 1 for command delivery.
- Reliability patterns: Use sequence numbers, acks/nacks, and periodic heartbeats. Coalesce/batch param updates within 16–33 ms frames; drop older frames when behind. Exponential backoff with jitter (already planned in Task 2) and fast‑path resume after heartbeat recovery.
- Data contracts: Normalize commands as `CommandEnvelope { id, ts, seq, type, payload, groupId?, ttlMs }` and state snapshots as `StateFrame { ts, devices[], scene }`. Keep commands idempotent and versioned; include `capabilities` for per‑device feature gating.
- Performance budgets: Aim for <50 ms end‑to‑end for live control; <15 ms for audio‑reactive parameters. Keep control frames <1–2 KB. Use binary WS only if JSON becomes a bottleneck.
- Testing strategy: Add a device simulator (WS server) to replay fixtures and validate group broadcasts, acks, and recovery. Use fake clocks to test timecode alignment and backoff. Include E2E smoke: build a scene, assign two simulated devices, start cue, verify synchronized color frames.

**PF‑5 AI‑Powered Creative Features**

- Feature set: Palette generation from image/video; audio‑reactive parameter mapping (BPM, onsets, energy bands); text‑to‑scene prompt that maps style terms to patterns/palettes; “Intelligent transitions” that choose easing and durations from context.
- Inference architecture: Prefer local/browser inference for low latency/private inputs using ONNX Runtime Web (WASM/WebGPU) or TensorFlow.js. For heavier models (e.g., CLIP for text semantics), run a microservice over WebSocket with short‑lived JWT and stream incremental results; always provide heuristic fallbacks.
- Practical models/algorithms: Palette extraction via median‑cut or K‑means with CIEDE2000 distance; beat/onset via spectral flux and adaptive thresholds (Meyda or Essentia.js in WASM); tempo smoothing with Viterbi/HMM; text‑to‑parameters via a compact ruleset backed by embeddings rather than a large LLM for deterministic behavior.
- Real‑time audio plumbing: Use `AudioWorklet` for low‑latency DSP, post results over `MessagePort` to the UI store. Keep ring buffers and typed arrays to avoid GC. Downsample features to 60 Hz to match render/control loops.
- UX and safety: Always bound outputs by device constraints (max brightness, thermal limits). Make generative outputs reproducible with seeds and snapshot the derived “creative preset” for later recall. Show confidence/quality indicators for model outputs.
- Testing: Golden‑file tests for palette extraction and audio features (use recorded clips). Deterministic tests by fixing seeds. For any remote inference, add contract tests with pinned model versions and confidence thresholds.

**PF‑6 Advanced Visualization And AR/VR**

- Digital twin: Use Three.js for a 3D fixture layout; represent LEDs as GPU‑instanced meshes with per‑instance colors in a `InstancedBufferAttribute`. Maintain a `VisualizerStore` that ingests the same `StateFrame` used for devices, decimated to 60 fps.
- Rendering pipeline: Linear‑space rendering with correct sRGB conversion; tone mapping for HDR‑ish looks. Offload heavy work to `OffscreenCanvas`/Web Worker where supported to keep UI responsive. Use frame‑time budgets and dynamic decimation when CPU/GPU are saturated.
- AR calibration: Provide an AR view using WebXR or AR.js with ArUco/AprilTag markers to solve a transform from world -> device coordinates. Store per‑installation calibration and re‑use it for precise overlays. Handle occlusion with depth API where available.
- VR planning: Add an optional WebXR VR scene to compose complex shows spatially; allow scrubbing timelines and previewing transitions. Share the same scene graph and materials between preview and VR to avoid drift.
- Interaction and safety: Ray‑pick fixtures to select/inspect; enforce selection bounds and collision layers so AR/VR interactions cannot send unsafe live commands. Expose a “Preview only” mode that never controls real devices.
- Testing: Headless WebGL snapshot tests for the shader pipeline; fixture coordinate transforms round‑trip tests; AR calibration unit tests with synthetic marker poses.

**PF‑7 Enterprise Management And Security**

- Identity and access: Support OIDC/SAML SSO; implement RBAC with roles like `Viewer`, `Operator`, `Designer`, `Admin`. Optionally add ABAC for site/room constraints. Use SCIM for user/group provisioning. Enforce MFA and session policies.
- Device security: Provision devices with unique X.509 certs, use mTLS for controller↔device, rotate certs periodically. Sign firmware images and updates (TUF/Uptane patterns). Store secrets in an HSM/KMS; never embed credentials client‑side.
- Transport and session: Enforce TLS 1.2+ with modern ciphers; short‑lived access tokens (JWT) with refresh; sender‑constrained tokens (DPoP or mTLS‑bound) for high‑risk operations. For WebSockets, validate origin/subprotocol, use short‑lived auth and periodic re‑auth.
- Policy and audit: Implement org policies (max brightness, quiet hours, change approvals). Emit structured audit logs for auth, scene changes, device actions with `who/what/where/when`. Integrate with SIEM via syslog or HTTPS drain.
- Compliance and hygiene: Set strong CSP, SRI for static assets, and dependency scanning. Encrypt data at rest; minimize PII. Establish backups with restore drills. Provide tamper‑evident logs for regulated deployments (SOC 2/ISO 27001 alignment).
- Observability and SLOs: Instrument with OpenTelemetry for traces/metrics (latency, WS reconnects, frame drops). Define SLOs (e.g., p95 control latency <50 ms, reconnect <5 s) and track error budgets.

**Data Contracts (Examples)**

- Device: `DeviceDescriptor { id, host, name, caps:{leds, fps, protocols}, lastSeen, firmware, certFingerprint }`
- Group: `Group { id, name, deviceIds[], policies?, tags? }`
- Command: `CommandEnvelope { id, ts, seq, type:'SelectPattern'|'UpdateParams'|'SetPalette'|'PlayCue', payload, groupId?, ttlMs }`
- Heartbeat/Ack: `Heartbeat { ts, deviceId, rttMs, battery?, temp? }`, `Ack { seq, status:'ok'|'err', errCode? }`
- Scene/Cue: `Scene { id, name, tracks[], metadata }`, `Cue { id, startsAt, durationMs, curve, paramsDelta }`

**How This Maps To Current Tasks**

- Task 10 (Docs/tests): Add ADRs for Orchestration Topology (authoritative vs CRDT), Timebase/Sync, Messaging (WS vs MQTT vs sACN), AI Inference Architecture, and Visualization Pipeline. Create fixtures for `CommandEnvelope`, `StateFrame`, audio‑feature frames, and visualization transforms. Add E2E smoke: two simulated devices join a group, play a cue, verify synchronized color frames and reconnection behavior.
- Task 2 (K1 provider): Evolve `K1Provider` to support multiple devices and groups: `connectMany(deviceEndpoints)`, `setGroup(groupId, deviceIds)`, `broadcast(cmd)`, heartbeats and jittered backoff per connection. Maintain `capabilities` and expose `timebase.now()` for cue alignment.
- Task 3 (Discovery/UI): Implement mDNS discovery with deduplication and `lastSeen` sorting, manual IP with validation, persistent device registry, and group assignment UI. Surface connection health with heartbeats and retry actions.
- Task 9 (Resilience/perf): Add `sendCoalescedParams()` that batches within a 16–33 ms window, sequence numbers and acks, drop stale frames, and enforce message size limits. Introduce `fetchWithRetry` and WS re‑auth. Measure startup and visualization frame time; lazy‑load AR/VR modules.

**Suggested Libraries/Tools**

- Orchestration: `mqtt` (if needed), `socket.io` (optional), `bonjour`/`mdns` for discovery, `fractional-indexing` for ordered cues, `zod` for runtime schema validation.
- AI/Audio: ONNX Runtime Web or TensorFlow.js; Meyda or Essentia.js (WASM) for audio features; seedable RNG (e.g., `seedrandom`) for reproducible outputs.
- Visualization: Three.js, WebXR, `ar.js` or `js-aruco`; `gl-matrix` for transforms; `stats.js` for frame diagnostics.
- Security/Enterprise: `openid-client` for OIDC, `node-forge` or platform TLS for cert ops, TUF client/server libs, OpenTelemetry SDKs.

**Next Steps**

- Do you want me to draft ADRs for orchestration, sync, AI inference, and visualization, and scaffold test fixtures/types for `CommandEnvelope`, `StateFrame`, and audio features? I can also outline provider changes to support multi‑device groups and heartbeats.
