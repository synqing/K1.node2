# Node Editor Design Brief (Figma-Ready)

**Status:** Placeholder (awaiting Task #2 execution)
**Created:** 2025-10-29 (PoC setup)
**Expected completion:** Day 12 of PoC

---

## Purpose

This document will be filled by **Task #2 agents** (Researcher → Architect → Designer handoff).

Agent #1 will research Node Editor design context and store in memory.
Agent #2 will propose integration patterns with Control Panel.
Agent #3 will synthesize a complete Figma brief.

**Expected content:**
- Canvas area specification (pan/zoom, grid snap, multi-select, mini-map)
- Node palette specification (categorized by type)
- Inspector panel specification (parameter editing)
- Graph pipeline panel specification (validate/compile/deploy steps)
- Integration diagram showing flow to Control Panel
- Component specs for nodes, edges, ports, handles
- Interaction specs (drag, connect, validate, etc.)
- Accessibility requirements (WCAG AA, keyboard operation)

**This document will be handed to Figma Make for full design system creation.**

## Checklist for Task #2 Completion

- [ ] Agent #1 (Researcher) completes: gathers design context, stores in memory
- [ ] Agent #2 (Architect) completes: proposes integration options, stores analysis
- [ ] Agent #3 (Designer) completes: synthesizes brief from all prior research
- [ ] Review: brief is actionable, includes architectural integration, ready for Figma
- [ ] Memory quality check: can we trace decisions back to Agent #1's research?
