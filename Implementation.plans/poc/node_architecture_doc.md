# Node Architecture Documentation (Figma-Ready)

**Status:** Placeholder (awaiting Task #1 execution)
**Created:** 2025-10-29 (PoC setup)
**Expected completion:** Day 5 of PoC

---

## Purpose

This document will be filled by **Task #1 agents** (Researcher → Writer handoff).

Agent #1 will research NODE_ARCHITECTURE.md and extract key insights into memory.
Agent #2 will query that memory and synthesize this Figma-friendly document.

**Expected content:**
- Overview of node categories (Generators, Transforms, Color Ops, Compositers)
- Node type listings with descriptions
- Compilation pipeline (JSON → C++ → firmware)
- Design implications for the Node Editor UI
- Integration points with Control Panel

**This document will be used as reference material for the Figma Make design handoff.**
