# KIRO Agent Brief: Phase C + PF-5 Strategic Roadmap Setup

**Prepared**: 2025-10-28
**For**: Kiro Coding Agent
**Status**: Ready for Execution
**Authority**: @spectrasynq (K1.reinvented Lead)

---

## YOUR MISSION (Executive Summary)

You are being asked to **set up the strategic orchestration layer** for a 30-week, 3-4 engineer initiative combining:
- **Phase C**: Node Graph Editor (visual pattern design interface) — Weeks 1-12
- **PF-5**: AI-Powered Creative Features (5 phases: audio, color, text, personalization, release) — Weeks 1-30

**Success Criteria**: By end of this task, you will have created a KIRO strategic roadmap that clearly shows:
1. ✅ 5-phase breakdown (C.1, C.2, C.3, C.4, then PF-5.1-5)
2. ✅ Milestones at Week 6, 12, 22, 30
3. ✅ Critical success factors documented (4-5 per phase)
4. ✅ Risks identified with severity and mitigation
5. ✅ Team roles assigned (Engineer 1, 2, 3 with clear responsibilities)
6. ✅ Integration points between Phase C and PF-5 mapped
7. ✅ Escalation paths and decision gates defined

**Outcome**: Engineering team can use KIRO for strategic visibility + TASKMASTER for tactical execution (handled separately). No ambiguity about who does what, when, or why.

---

## CRITICAL CONTEXT (Read This First)

### The "Why" Behind This Initiative

**Top-Level Priority**: PF-5 (AI-Powered Creative Features) is the #1 strategic initiative for K1.reinvented.

**Hard Dependency Discovered**: PF-5 cannot work without Phase C.
- PF-5 AI generates visual node graphs (text-to-pattern, audio-reactive patterns)
- Phase C provides the interface for users to see and iterate on these AI-generated patterns
- **Without Phase C, PF-5 AI has no UI to render results**

**Reframed Approach**: Phase C is not a separate feature—it's the foundational UI layer that enables PF-5 to function. They execute sequentially but with heavy overlap: Phase C ships at Week 12, PF-5 Phase 1 ships at Week 12 (same week), then they diverge as Phase C goes into maintenance mode and PF-5 scales through Phases 2-5.

### The Architecture (Shared Data Structure)

Both Phase C and PF-5 work with the same **GraphDocument** format:

```typescript
interface GraphDocument {
  nodes: NodeInstance[];         // Position, Sampler, Effect nodes
  wires: WireInstance[];         // Connections between nodes
  metadata: {
    source: 'manual' | 'audio' | 'color' | 'text';
    sourcePrompt?: string;       // If generated by AI
    timestamp?: number;
    author?: string;
  };
}
```

**Critical Implication**: Whoever designs the Phase C editor **must coordinate** with the PF-5 AI team on node/wire structure. Incompatibility at Week 4 is a project blocker.

### K1.reinvented System Overview

- **Core Concept**: JSON pattern definition → C++ code generation → Binary firmware for ESP32-S3
- **Performance**: 450+ FPS on device (after compilation)
- **Existing Node System**: 16 node types (Phase B complete)
  - Sources: Position (x,y), Time (t), Audio (spectrum, bass, treble)
  - Effects: Color transforms, motion, composition, blending
  - Output: 1 sink node (LED array)
- **Tech Stack**: React 18, TypeScript (strict mode), Canvas/SVG rendering, Zustand + Immer state (if available)
- **K1Provider**: Existing service that compiles patterns; Phase C will call this for real-time device feedback

### What Exists Today

**Phase C Specification** (33,000+ words, ready to implement):
- `docs/planning/PHASE_C_NODE_GRAPH_EDITOR_SPECIFICATION.md` — Technical spec (16 node types, 4 phases)
- `docs/planning/PHASE_C_EXECUTION_ROADMAP.md` — 48 subtasks, estimated 130-155 hours
- `docs/adr/ADR-0004-PHASE_C_NODE_EDITOR_ARCHITECTURE.md` — Design decisions
- Taskmaster Task #12 already created with all 48 subtasks pending

**PF-5 Specification** (54,000+ words, strategic direction clear):
- `docs/planning/PF5_IMPLEMENTATION_STRATEGY.md` — Full 5-phase architecture
- `docs/analysis/` — Market research, competitive analysis, AI feasibility
- Taskmaster Tasks #13-17 (pending creation, will be created AFTER Kiro setup)

**Integration Roadmap**:
- `docs/planning/PHASE_C_PF5_INTEGRATED_ROADMAP.md` — 30-week week-by-week breakdown

### 4. Identify and Track Risks

Document these risks in KIRO with **Severity** (Critical/High/Medium/Low) and **Mitigation**:

| Risk | Phase | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|-------|----------|-----------|
| **Node format incompatibility** | C.1 + PF-5.1 | **CRITICAL** | Week 4 integration test, design review gate |
| **Phase C schedule slip** | C (any) | **HIGH** | Weekly burndown review, early blocker flagging |
| **K1Provider conflicts** | C (all) | **MEDIUM** | Feature flags, dedicated namespace for C |
| **Canvas performance regression** | C.3 | **MEDIUM** | Continuous profiling, frame-time monitoring |
| **Web Audio browser incompatibility** | PF-5.1 | **MEDIUM** | Feature detection, graceful fallback, testing matrix |
| **AI model size too large** | PF-5.2-5 | **MEDIUM** | Quantization strategy, model selection (small models) |
| **Real-time audio latency >5ms** | PF-5.1 | **MEDIUM** | AudioWorklet tuning, buffer size optimization |
| **Integration test failure at Week 12** | C + PF-5.1 | **HIGH** | Integration tests start Week 6, not Week 11 |
| **TypeScript type brittleness** | C.1 | **MEDIUM** | Strict mode, comprehensive type tests, freeze schema Week 4 |
| **Performance regression in K1 app** | C (all) | **LOW** | Feature flag, separate route, no global state mutation |

**Escalation**: If any HIGH or CRITICAL risk materializes, escalate within 24 hours.

## INTEGRATION POINTS (Why Coordination Matters)

### GraphDocument Handoff (Week 4)
- Phase C.1 finalizes node/wire type definitions
- PF-5.1 confirms graph generation can produce valid documents
- Integration test: PF-5.1 generates 10 audio-reactive patterns, Phase C renders them without error
- **Go/No-Go Gate**: If test fails, re-plan both Phase C.2 and PF-5.2

### Phase C Preview Integration (Week 6)
- Phase C.3 (preview) ready for integration
- PF-5.1 feeds AI-generated graphs to preview
- Live demo: "Play audio, see pattern update in real-time"
- **M1 Delivery**: Core canvas, node rendering, basic preview working

### Phase C Release (Week 12)
- Phase C.4 (polish) complete
- Styling, validation, docs done
- Feature flag for Phase C editor in main app (can be disabled)
- **M2 Delivery**: PF-5.1 Phase 1 ships alongside (audio reactivity MVP)
- Users can: (a) manually create patterns, OR (b) generate via audio

### PF-5 Phase 2-5 Divergence (Weeks 13-30)
- Phase C stabilizes in production
- Engineer 1 shifts to bug fixes + performance optimization
- Engineers 2-3 continue PF-5 phases 2-5
- **Weekly integration tests** ensure new features don't break Phase C

## SUCCESS METRICS (How KIRO Tracks Progress)

**Milestone Achievement** (binary):
- M1 (Week 6): Phase C.1 complete (12/12 subtasks in TASKMASTER)
- M2 (Week 12): Phase C complete (48/48) + PF-5.1 complete (20/20)
- M3 (Week 22): PF-5.1-3 complete (55/55 subtasks)
- M4 (Week 30): All phases complete, full release

**Risk Tracking** (continuous):
- Critical risks: 0 at any time
- High risks: Mitigated within 1 week of identification
- Weekly risk review: Update severity/mitigation as context changes

**Team Velocity** (weekly):
- Engineering 1 (Phase C): 40-50 hours/week, target 48 subtasks in 12 weeks = 4 subtasks/week
- Engineering 2-3 (PF-5): 35-40 hours/week combined, target 75 subtasks in 30 weeks = 2.5/week
- Actual vs. planned: Track in TASKMASTER, report in KIRO weekly

**Integration Quality** (per milestone):
- M1: No regression in existing K1 app
- M2: Audio-to-pattern pipeline works end-to-end
- M3: Text-to-pattern generates valid graphs
- M4: Full system stable, <1% critical bugs in first month

## ESCALATION PATHS (Who to Contact)

**Daily Operations**: Engineer leads + @spectrasynq in weekly Tuesday sync

**Blocker (4-hour response)**:
- Code blocker → Escalate in Slack #engineering
- Architectural conflict → Create ADR draft, escalate to @spectrasynq
- Resource request → Escalate to @spectrasynq

**Milestone Risk (>3 day slip)**:
- Flag in KIRO immediately
- Schedule escalation meeting with @spectrasynq within 24 hours
- Propose re-plan: descope features, extend timeline, or add resources

**Critical Risk Materialization** (security, performance, compatibility):
- Halt that workstream
- Document root cause in ADR or blocker file
- Escalate to @spectrasynq for decision on mitigation

---

## YOUR DELIVERABLE

By the end of this task, KIRO must contain:

- ✅ 5-phase structure (C.1-C.4, PF-5.1-5) with descriptions
- ✅ 4 milestones (Week 6, 12, 22, 30) with go/no-go criteria
- ✅ 20+ critical success factors (4-5 per major phase)
- ✅ 10 documented risks with severity and mitigation
- ✅ 3 team roles clearly defined (Engineer 1 = Phase C, Engineer 2 = Audio+Color, Engineer 3 = Text+Personalization)
- ✅ Integration points mapped (Week 4, 6, 12, 22, 30 gates)
- ✅ Success metrics defined (binary milestones, risk tracking, velocity, quality)
- ✅ Escalation paths clear (who, when, how)

Once KIRO is set up, @spectrasynq will:
1. Expand TASKMASTER Task #12 (Phase C: already exists, 48 subtasks)
2. Create TASKMASTER Tasks #13-17 (PF-5 Phases 1-5: 75 subtasks total)
3. Schedule Week 1 kickoff meeting
4. Assign engineers to tasks

## FILES TO REFERENCE WHILE SETTING UP KIRO

**Phase C Specification**:
- `/docs/planning/PHASE_C_NODE_GRAPH_EDITOR_SPECIFICATION.md` (14,000 words)
- `/docs/planning/PHASE_C_EXECUTION_ROADMAP.md` (8,000 words)
- `/docs/adr/ADR-0004-PHASE_C_NODE_EDITOR_ARCHITECTURE.md` (4,000 words)

**PF-5 Strategy**:
- `/docs/planning/PF5_IMPLEMENTATION_STRATEGY.md` (21,000 words)
- `/docs/planning/PHASE_C_PF5_INTEGRATED_ROADMAP.md` (30-week breakdown)

**Integrated Planning**:
- `/Implementation.plans/roadmaps/PHASE_C_PF5_INTEGRATED_ROADMAP.md`

**Existing Taskmaster**:
- `/.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json` → Task #12 (Phase C, 48 subtasks, pending)

---

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **PF-5 is #1 priority**, Phase C is the enabler. Don't reorder phases.
2. **Week 4 is make-or-break** for Phase C + PF-5.1 integration. Invest heavily in design reviews and integration testing.
3. **Parallel execution** (C + PF-5.1 Weeks 1-12) requires tight coordination. Weekly syncs are mandatory.
4. **Node format is immutable after Week 4**. Changing it cascades delays to PF-5 and Phase C.3-4.
5. **Escalate early and often**. Blockers are expensive; visibility prevents surprises.

---

## WHAT HAPPENS AFTER YOU (KIRO) ARE DONE

1. **TASKMASTER Setup** (1 hour): Expand Task #12, create Tasks #13-17 with subtasks
2. **Week 1 Kickoff** (2 hours): Engineer briefings, context transfer, tool orientation
3. **Weeks 1-30**: Execution tracked in TASKMASTER, strategic oversight in KIRO
4. **Weekly Syncs** (30 min): Status update, risk review, escalation
5. **Milestone Gates** (1 hour each): Go/no-go decision, adjust plan if needed

---

**You're now primed. Set up the KIRO roadmap. Ask @spectrasynq questions only if structural ambiguity arises.**

**Expected completion time**: 2 hours (reading + roadmap setup)
