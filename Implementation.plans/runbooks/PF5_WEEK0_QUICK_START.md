# PF-5 Week 0: QUICK START (TODAY)

**Objective**: Get Phase 1 execution unblocked and teams moving by COB TODAY

**Time Required**: 45 minutes (for decision-maker only)

---

## BLOCKING ACTIONS (MUST DO TODAY)

### 1. Assign Phase C Ownership (10 minutes)

**Question**: Which team will take Phase C (node editor + undo/redo)?

**Action**:
- [ ] Identify team/person responsible for Phase C
- [ ] Document decision in Slack/email
- [ ] Create link in `docs/reports/PHASE_C_TRANSFER_HANDOFF.md`

**Impact**: If not done → Phase 1 timeline blocked (risk paralysis)

**Context**: Phase C is currently transferred status = other team. No code changes needed for PF-5.

---

### 2. Lock Phase 1 Team (10 minutes)

**Question**: Who are the 2 engineers for Phase 1 (audio validation)?

**Needs**:
- **Audio Validation Lead** (90%, Weeks 1-12)
  - Responsibilities: Latency validation, beat accuracy testing (MIREX), edge cases, mobile audio
  - Skills: Audio DSP, performance profiling, test automation
- **Frontend Engineer** (50%, Weeks 1-12)
  - Responsibilities: Preset tuning, mobile testing, component tests, analytics
  - Skills: React, TypeScript, device testing

**Action**:
- [ ] Get commitment from 2 engineers (verbal is fine for now)
- [ ] Record names in Slack or email
- [ ] Schedule team kick-off meeting (Thursday or Friday)

**Impact**: If not done → Week 1 cannot start (no owner to execute MIREX validation)

---

### 3. Confirm K1 Hardware (5 minutes)

**Question**: Is at least 1 K1 device available for Phase 1 team?

**Action**:
- [ ] Verify hardware location/availability
- [ ] If not available → order urgently (iPhone SE + Galaxy S8 for mobile testing)
- [ ] Document in Slack/team calendar

**Impact**: If not done → Cannot validate audio reactivity on real hardware (blocker for go/no-go)

---

### 4. Approve Week 0 Plan (5 minutes)

**Review the decision gates**:
```
✅ Phase 1 code complete (85%)
✅ MIREX validation plan documented
⏳ Phase C transfer ownership (DO THIS NOW)
⏳ Phase 1 team assigned (DO THIS NOW)
⏳ K1 hardware confirmed (DO THIS NOW)
```

**Decision**:
- [ ] All 5 gates will pass by EOW? **YES → Approve Week 1 execution**
- [ ] Any gate will fail? **→ Document blocker, escalate, reschedule**

---

## IMMEDIATE (THIS WEEK)

### Day 1 (Today, if possible)
- [ ] Assign Phase C ownership → Slack announcement
- [ ] Assign Phase 1 Audio Lead → Slack announcement
- [ ] Assign Phase 1 Frontend Engineer → Slack announcement
- [ ] Confirm K1 hardware → Team calendar invite
- [ ] Create Slack channel #pf5-phase1

### Day 2-3
- [ ] Audio Lead: Review MIREX_BEAT_VALIDATION_CHECKLIST.md (15 min)
- [ ] Frontend Lead: Review PF5_WEEK_0_KICKOFF.md code readiness section (15 min)
- [ ] All: Review PF5_EXECUTIVE_BRIEF.md (5 min)

### Day 4 (End of Week)
- [ ] Phase 1 team: Schedule Monday kick-off meeting
- [ ] Audio Lead: Download SMC dataset prep (5 GB, can happen this weekend)
- [ ] Frontend: Run `npm run type-check` and `npm run lint` (verify pass)

### Day 5+ (Following Monday)
- **Week 1 Execution Begins**: MIREX infrastructure setup, beat accuracy testing, latency measurement

---

## 5-MINUTE GO/NO-GO DECISION CHECKLIST

Before approving Week 1 execution, verify:

| Item | Status | Owner | Blocker? |
|------|--------|-------|----------|
| Phase C team assigned | TBD | @spectrasynq | YES |
| Phase 1 Audio Lead assigned | TBD | @spectrasynq | YES |
| Phase 1 Frontend assigned | TBD | @spectrasynq | YES |
| K1 hardware confirmed | TBD | Hardware lead | YES |
| Code audit (npm run type-check) | ✅ PASS | Frontend | NO |
| Documentation complete | ✅ DONE | Claude Code | NO |
| MIREX plan documented | ✅ DONE | Claude Code | NO |

**Decision Logic**:
- All team + hardware items ✅ → **GO FOR WEEK 1**
- Any team + hardware item ❌ → **STOP, escalate, reschedule**
- Code/docs item ❌ → **Fix before Week 1 start (low risk)**

---

## KEY DOCUMENTS TO REVIEW

**Executive Level** (5 minutes):
- `docs/reports/PF5_EXECUTIVE_BRIEF.md` → one-pager with timeline + risks

**Team Lead Level** (15 minutes):
- `docs/reports/PF5_WEEK0_STATUS_DASHBOARD.md` → status + blockers
- `Implementation.plans/runbooks/PF5_WEEK_0_KICKOFF.md` → detailed checklist

**Engineer Level** (1 hour):
- `docs/analysis/MIREX_BEAT_TRACKING_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md` → technical reference
- `Implementation.plans/runbooks/MIREX_BEAT_VALIDATION_CHECKLIST.md` → 4-week plan

## FAILURE SCENARIOS & ESCALATION

**Scenario 1**: Phase C team not assigned
- **Impact**: Medium (no blocking impact on PF-5, but creates organizational debt)
- **Action**: Escalate to @spectrasynq for final assignment
- **Timeline**: Must resolve by EOW

**Scenario 2**: Phase 1 Audio Lead not available
- **Impact**: CRITICAL (cannot execute MIREX validation)
- **Action**: Find substitute immediately or delay Week 1
- **Timeline**: Must resolve TODAY

**Scenario 3**: K1 hardware unavailable
- **Impact**: CRITICAL (cannot validate on real device)
- **Action**: Order test devices urgently (iPhone SE + Galaxy S8)
- **Timeline**: Can proceed with simulators Week 1, hardware testing Week 3+

**Scenario 4**: Code audit fails (TypeScript errors)
- **Impact**: Low (code is 85% complete, easy to fix)
- **Action**: Frontend engineer fixes by Wednesday
- **Timeline**: Does not block Week 1 (can fix in parallel)

---

## SUCCESS METRICS FOR WEEK 0
