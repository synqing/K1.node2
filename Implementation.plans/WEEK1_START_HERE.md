## The 3.5-Hour Timeline

```
0:00‚Äì0:10  Intro + prep              (read docs)
0:10‚Äì0:40  Part 1: Three scenarios   (run eval_single.py 3x)

---

## What You'll Accomplish

### By End of Part 1 (30 min)
‚úÖ You understand what each metric value means
‚úÖ You can recognize a Goto=0.0 diagnosis (wrong tempo)
‚úÖ You see why Cemgil is stricter than F-measure

### By End of Part 2 (60 min)
‚úÖ You created an intentional error in beat data
‚úÖ You measured how metrics changed
‚úÖ You connected error type to metric changes

### By End of Part 3 (90 min)
‚úÖ You answered analysis questions in writing
‚úÖ You made predictions and tested them
‚úÖ You understand why metrics matter before building algorithms

---

## Before You Start: Setup (5 min)

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd firmware/K1.node2/beats

# Install dependencies (one time)
pip install mir-eval numpy librosa

# Verify it works
python eval_single.py --help
```

If this works ‚Üí you're ready to start

If it fails ‚Üí see "Setup Issues" below

---

## The Key Insight (Read This First)

```
F-measure says IF you're detecting beats correctly.
Cemgil says HOW precisely you're detecting them.
Goto says if you're looking at the RIGHT PROBLEM.

Example:
- F-measure = 0.67 (seems mediocre)
- Cemgil = 0.67 (consistently off)
- Goto = 0.0 (ALERT: wrong tempo detected)

Diagnosis: You're not missing beats, you're detecting
them at 2x speed. Different problem. Different fix.

This insight saves you 20 hours of debugging.
```

---

## The Three Scenarios You'll See

### Scenario 1: Perfect Match
```
Reference: 1532 beats
Estimate:  1532 beats (identical)

Result:
F-measure = 1.0 ‚úÖ
Cemgil = 1.0 ‚úÖ
Goto = 1.0 ‚úÖ
Other metrics = NaN (normal!)

Lesson: Understand what "perfect" looks like
```

### Scenario 2: Tempo Doubling
```
Reference: 1532 beats
Estimate:  766 beats (every other beat)

Result:
F-measure = 0.67
Cemgil = 0.67
Goto = 0.0 ‚ö†Ô∏è (DIAGNOSIS: wrong tempo)
```

### Scenario 3: Timing Jitter
```
Reference: 1532 beats
Estimate:  1532 beats (each ¬±50ms random)

Result:
F-measure = 0.83 (looks OK)
Cemgil = 0.63 (much lower!) ‚ö†Ô∏è
Goto = 0.0 (phase is drifting)

Lesson: F-measure is optimistic; Cemgil is stricter
```

---

## Commands You'll Run

```bash
# Perfect match (baseline)
python eval_single.py --ref data/harmonix/reference/0010_andjusticeforall.txt \
                      --est data/harmonix/reference/0010_andjusticeforall.txt

# Tempo doubling error
python eval_single.py --ref data/harmonix/reference/0010_andjusticeforall.txt \
                      --est estimates/0010_test_tempo_double.txt

# Timing jitter
python eval_single.py --ref data/harmonix/reference/0010_andjusticeforall.txt \
                      --est estimates/0010_test_jitter.txt

# Your own track (choose one)
TRACK="0001_12step"
python eval_single.py --ref data/harmonix/reference/${TRACK}.txt \
                      --est estimates/${TRACK}_YOUR_ERROR.txt
```

---

‚úÖ You can run eval_single.py without errors
‚úÖ You can explain what Goto=0.0 means
‚úÖ You can explain why Cemgil < F-measure for jitter
‚úÖ You created and tested your own error scenario
‚úÖ You answered all analysis questions
‚úÖ You made predictions and tested them
‚úÖ You wrote a learning summary

---

## Common Questions (Before You Start)

### Q: Do I need to understand Python to do this?
**A:** No. You're running pre-written scripts and reading outputs. Copy-paste is fine.

### Q: What if I get NaN values?
**A:** That's normal! It means you have perfect beats. Read WEEK1_MIREX_METRICS_LEARNING.md to understand why.

### Q: How long will this take?
**A:** 3.5 hours total. 30 min for examples, 60 min for your experiment, 90 min for analysis.

### Q: Can I skip Part 3 (the homework)?
**A:** No. Parts 1 & 2 teach facts. Part 3 teaches you to THINK. That's what matters.

### Q: What if I don't understand a metric?
**A:** See WEEK1_MIREX_METRICS_LEARNING.md section "Metric Definitions".

### Issue: "FileNotFoundError: data/harmonix/reference/..."
```bash
# Verify you're in the right directory
pwd  # Should end in: firmware/K1.node2/beats

# Verify files exist
ls data/harmonix/reference/ | head
```

### Issue: "Permission denied" on Python
```bash
# Make sure it's executable
chmod +x eval_single.py

## Last Thought

This week feels like learning details. It is.

But these details are the difference between:
- üò´ "Why is my beat detector giving Goto=0.0?" (40 hours of debugging)
- üéØ "Goto=0.0 means I'm detecting tempo wrong. Let me fix the tempo estimation." (1 hour)

Invest 3.5 hours now. Save 40 hours next week.

---

## Ready to Start?

1. ‚úÖ Did you run setup commands? (pip install, chmod, etc.)
2. ‚úÖ Did you print WEEK1_QUICK_REFERENCE.md?
3. ‚úÖ Do you have WEEK1_TEAM_EXECUTION_CHECKLIST.md open?

If yes ‚Üí You're ready. Start Part 1.

If no ‚Üí Do that now.

See you on the other side of Week 1!
