# Node Graph Audit and Remediation Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the comprehensive audit and remediation process for removed node graph files from the K1.reinvented system. The audit must ensure compliance with documented audio-reactive light show specifications, validate adherence to static light show mode configuration standards, and identify deviations from mandated workflows and hierarchies.

## Glossary

- **Node Graph**: JSON-based visual programming definition that compiles to C++ pattern code
- **Center-Origin Architecture**: Mandated coordinate system where position_gradient returns distance from center (0.0 at center â†’ 1.0 at edges)
- **Audio-Reactive Pattern**: Pattern that uses audio input nodes (spectrum_bin, spectrum_range, beat, audio_level, chromagram)
- **Static Pattern**: Pattern that uses only time-based or position-based nodes without audio input
- **Palette Interpolation**: Color mapping system using palette_data arrays with position-based color lookup
- **Signal Processing Chain**: Ordered sequence of nodes that transform audio/time data into visual output
- **Compliance Violation**: Any implementation that deviates from documented architectural standards
- **Remediation Plan**: Strategy for fixing non-compliant implementations while preserving functional components

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Comprehensive File Audit

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want all removed node graph files audited against current specifications, so that I can identify compliance violations and architectural deviations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the audit process begins, THE audit system SHALL examine all JSON files in the Implementation.plans/Graphs directory
2. WHEN each file is processed, THE audit system SHALL validate node type compliance against the documented node specification
3. WHEN audio-reactive patterns are identified, THE audit system SHALL verify proper signal processing chain implementation
4. WHEN static patterns are identified, THE audit system SHALL validate timing and synchronization logic compliance
5. THE audit system SHALL document all findings with specific violation details and file references

### Requirement 2: Architecture Compliance Validation

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want center-origin architecture compliance verified, so that no edge-to-edge rainbow patterns contaminate the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN position_gradient nodes are found, THE audit system SHALL verify they implement center-origin coordinate mapping
2. IF gradient nodes are found, THEN THE audit system SHALL flag them as architectural violations
3. WHEN palette_interpolate nodes are found, THE audit system SHALL verify they use proper palette_data format
4. THE audit system SHALL identify any patterns that create edge-to-edge linear gradients
5. THE audit system SHALL validate that all spatial patterns originate from center coordinates

### Requirement 3: Audio-Reactive Signal Chain Validation

**User Story:** As an audio engineer, I want audio-reactive patterns validated for proper signal processing, so that audio responsiveness meets performance standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN spectrum_bin nodes are found, THE audit system SHALL verify bin parameters are within 0-63 range
2. WHEN spectrum_range nodes are found, THE audit system SHALL validate start_bin and end_bin parameters
3. WHEN beat nodes are found, THE audit system SHALL verify tempo_bin parameters and beat sensitivity configuration
4. WHEN audio_level nodes are found, THE audit system SHALL validate VU meter implementation
5. THE audit system SHALL verify audio nodes are properly connected in signal processing chains

### Requirement 4: Static Pattern Timing Validation

**User Story:** As a pattern designer, I want static patterns validated for proper timing logic, so that animations run smoothly without timing artifacts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN time nodes are found, THE audit system SHALL verify they connect to appropriate mathematical operations
2. WHEN sin nodes are found, THE audit system SHALL validate input connections and parameter ranges
3. WHEN modulo nodes are found, THE audit system SHALL verify divisor parameters prevent division by zero
4. THE audit system SHALL validate that timing chains produce smooth animation curves
5. THE audit system SHALL identify any timing logic that could cause visual artifacts

### Requirement 5: Cross-Reference Against Current System

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want removed graphs cross-referenced against current implementation, so that I can identify gaps and inconsistencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing against current patterns, THE audit system SHALL identify missing functionality in current implementation
2. WHEN comparing node types, THE audit system SHALL verify all used node types are supported in current codegen system
3. WHEN comparing palette systems, THE audit system SHALL validate palette_data format compatibility
4. THE audit system SHALL identify any advanced features in removed graphs not present in current system
5. THE audit system SHALL document feature gaps that require implementation

### Requirement 6: Quality Control and Remediation Planning

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want a remediation plan with quality controls, so that reintegration maintains system integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN violations are identified, THE audit system SHALL categorize them by severity (critical, major, minor)
2. WHEN creating remediation plans, THE audit system SHALL preserve salvageable compliant components
3. WHEN marking sections for redesign, THE audit system SHALL provide specific correction guidance
4. THE audit system SHALL establish validation tests for each pattern type
5. THE audit system SHALL create peer review requirements for modified graphs

### Requirement 7: Safe Reintegration Strategy

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a safe reintegration strategy, so that non-compliant designs don't contaminate the main system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN preparing for reintegration, THE audit system SHALL create isolated testing environment requirements
2. WHEN validating fixed patterns, THE audit system SHALL run compliance verification tests
3. WHEN approving patterns for integration, THE audit system SHALL require architectural review sign-off
4. THE audit system SHALL establish rollback procedures for failed integrations
5. THE audit system SHALL create monitoring requirements for post-integration validation

### Requirement 8: Documentation and Reporting

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want comprehensive audit documentation, so that I can track remediation progress and ensure compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the audit completes, THE audit system SHALL generate a detailed compliance report
2. WHEN violations are found, THE audit system SHALL document specific instances with file references
3. WHEN remediation plans are created, THE audit system SHALL include implementation timelines
4. THE audit system SHALL create verification procedures documentation
5. THE audit system SHALL establish proper implementation pattern documentation for future reference
