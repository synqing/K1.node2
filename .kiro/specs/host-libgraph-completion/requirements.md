# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Complete the host/libgraph C++17 graph library implementation to match the provided bash script specification. The library provides CSR (Compressed Sparse Row) graph representation with core algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, topological sort, cycle detection), JSON I/O capabilities, metrics computation, and benchmarking tools.

## Glossary

- **CSR_Graph**: Compressed Sparse Row graph data structure with offsets, edges, and optional weights vectors
- **Graph_Library**: The k1::graph C++17 static library providing graph algorithms and I/O
- **JSON_Loader**: Component that parses JSON files to create CSR graph instances
- **Metrics_System**: Component that computes and exports graph statistics to JSON
- **Benchmark_Tool**: Executable that measures algorithm performance and outputs timing data
- **CI_Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing and validation
