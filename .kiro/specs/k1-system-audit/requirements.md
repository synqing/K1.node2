# K1.reinvented System Audit Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines a comprehensive technical audit of the K1.reinvented light show control system to identify and resolve critical functionality issues. The audit will compare current behavior against the original Emotiscope reference implementation and provide actionable fixes.

## Glossary

- **K1 System**: The K1.reinvented LED controller firmware and web interface
- **Emotiscope Reference**: Original Emotiscope 1.0 implementation at /Users/spectrasynq/Downloads/Emotiscope-2.0/Emotiscope-1/src
- **Palette System**: Color gradient selection and application system
- **Control Sliders**: Web UI parameter controls (brightness, speed, etc.)
- **Light Show Modes**: Individual pattern implementations (Pulse, Spectrum, etc.)
- **Data Flow**: Complete path from UI interaction to LED hardware output
- **Signal Path**: Electronic/software pathway for control signals

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Palette System Investigation

**User Story:** As a user, I want palette selection to immediately change the colors of my light show patterns, so that I can customize the visual appearance in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select a palette from the dropdown, THE K1 System SHALL update the LED colors within 500ms
2. WHEN I change patterns while a palette is selected, THE K1 System SHALL maintain the selected palette colors
3. WHEN I refresh the web interface, THE K1 System SHALL preserve the previously selected palette
4. IF palette selection fails, THEN THE K1 System SHALL display an error message and maintain current colors
5. THE K1 System SHALL provide visual feedback during palette transitions

### Requirement 2: Control Slider Functionality Audit

**User Story:** As a user, I want all control sliders to respond immediately to my input, so that I can adjust light show parameters in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I move the brightness slider, THE K1 System SHALL adjust LED brightness proportionally
2. WHEN I move the speed slider, THE K1 System SHALL change pattern animation speed accordingly  
3. WHEN I move the saturation slider, THE K1 System SHALL modify color saturation in real-time
4. WHEN I move custom parameter sliders, THE K1 System SHALL pass values to the active pattern
5. THE K1 System SHALL NOT include non-functional sliders in the interface

### Requirement 3: Light Show Mode Verification

**User Story:** As a developer, I want each light show mode to behave identically to the original Emotiscope implementation, so that users receive the expected visual experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing Pulse pattern behavior, THE K1 System SHALL match Emotiscope timing and wave propagation
2. WHEN comparing Spectrum pattern behavior, THE K1 System SHALL display identical frequency response
3. WHEN comparing Beat Tunnel pattern behavior, THE K1 System SHALL synchronize beats with identical phase alignment
4. WHEN comparing Tempiscope pattern behavior, THE K1 System SHALL show tempo visualization with matching resolution
5. THE K1 System SHALL maintain frame rates within 5% of Emotiscope performance benchmarks

### Requirement 4: System Configuration Review

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all configuration parameters to be correctly set and documented, so that the system operates reliably without hidden failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE K1 System SHALL have all required configuration files present and valid
2. THE K1 System SHALL report configuration errors clearly in system logs
3. THE K1 System SHALL validate all runtime parameters against acceptable ranges
4. THE K1 System SHALL document all non-obvious configuration dependencies
5. THE K1 System SHALL provide diagnostic information for troubleshooting

### Requirement 5: Comprehensive Technical Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want detailed technical documentation of all identified issues, so that I can prioritize and implement fixes efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Audit Report SHALL document each issue with specific code references
2. THE Audit Report SHALL provide priority rankings based on user impact
3. THE Audit Report SHALL include implementation complexity estimates for each fix
4. THE Audit Report SHALL compare current behavior with Emotiscope reference side-by-side
5. THE Audit Report SHALL include regression testing procedures for validation

### Requirement 6: Testing and Validation Framework

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive testing procedures to verify all fixes, so that repairs don't introduce new issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Testing Framework SHALL verify each fix against Emotiscope reference behavior
2. THE Testing Framework SHALL include regression tests for all system components
3. THE Testing Framework SHALL validate hardware communication at each repair stage
4. THE Testing Framework SHALL provide automated test execution where possible
5. THE Testing Framework SHALL document manual testing procedures for complex scenarios
