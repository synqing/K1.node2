# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for creating comprehensive architectural documentation for the K1 Control App. The documentation will serve as a technical reference for developers working on the application, covering the React/TypeScript architecture, build toolchain, supporting infrastructure, and visual diagrams. This documentation is critical for developer onboarding, maintenance, and future enhancements.

## Glossary

- **K1 Control App**: The React-based web application for controlling K1.reinvented LED devices
- **Build Toolchain**: The collection of tools and configurations used to compile, bundle, and optimize the application (Vite, TypeScript, etc.)
- **Component Hierarchy**: The organizational structure of React components from root to leaf nodes
- **State Management**: The approach used to manage and share application state across components
- **Documentation System**: The collection of markdown files, diagrams, and technical references that describe the application architecture
- **Vite**: The build tool and development server used by the application
- **SWC**: The Rust-based JavaScript/TypeScript compiler used via Vite plugin
- **Radix UI**: The headless UI component library used for accessible primitives
- **shadcn/ui**: The component system built on top of Radix UI and Tailwind CSS

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: React/TypeScript Architecture Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer joining the K1 Control App project, I want comprehensive documentation of the React/TypeScript architecture, so that I can quickly understand the codebase structure and make informed development decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Documentation System SHALL document the complete component hierarchy from App.tsx root to all leaf components
2. WHEN a developer reviews the architecture documentation, THE Documentation System SHALL provide a visual component tree diagram showing parent-child relationships
3. THE Documentation System SHALL document all TypeScript configuration settings including compiler options, path aliases, and module resolution
4. THE Documentation System SHALL identify and document the state management approach used (props drilling, Context API, or external library)
5. THE Documentation System SHALL list all React version dependencies and related packages with their purposes

### Requirement 2: Build Toolchain Configuration Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the build process, I want detailed documentation of the build toolchain configuration, so that I can troubleshoot build issues and optimize the build process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Documentation System SHALL document the complete Vite configuration including all plugins, aliases, and build settings
2. THE Documentation System SHALL document the TypeScript compilation setup including SWC plugin configuration
3. WHEN comparing development and production builds, THE Documentation System SHALL document the differences in configuration and output
4. THE Documentation System SHALL document the hot module replacement (HMR) configuration and behavior
5. THE Documentation System SHALL provide a visual workflow diagram showing the build process from source to output

### Requirement 3: Supporting Infrastructure Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer setting up the development environment, I want documentation of all supporting infrastructure, so that I can configure my environment correctly and understand the quality assurance processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. IF testing frameworks are configured, THEN THE Documentation System SHALL document the testing setup including framework, configuration, and test patterns
2. IF linting or formatting tools are configured, THEN THE Documentation System SHALL document ESLint and Prettier configurations
3. THE Documentation System SHALL document the package.json structure including all scripts, dependencies, and devDependencies with their purposes
4. THE Documentation System SHALL identify any CI/CD pipeline integration points or configuration files
5. THE Documentation System SHALL document the dependency management strategy and version pinning approach

### Requirement 4: Visual Diagrams and Technical References

**User Story:** As a developer understanding the system architecture, I want visual diagrams and clear technical references, so that I can quickly grasp complex relationships and workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Documentation System SHALL include a Mermaid diagram showing the component hierarchy and data flow
2. THE Documentation System SHALL include a Mermaid diagram showing the build process workflow
3. THE Documentation System SHALL include a Mermaid diagram showing the module dependency graph for key subsystems
4. WHEN documenting configurations, THE Documentation System SHALL use code blocks with syntax highlighting
5. THE Documentation System SHALL organize content with clear section headers and table of contents

### Requirement 5: Optimization Opportunities and Best Practices

**User Story:** As a technical lead reviewing the architecture, I want identified optimization opportunities and best practices, so that I can plan improvements and maintain code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Documentation System SHALL identify potential performance optimization opportunities in the build configuration
2. THE Documentation System SHALL identify potential code organization improvements
3. THE Documentation System SHALL document current best practices being followed
4. THE Documentation System SHALL note any deviations from React/TypeScript best practices
5. THE Documentation System SHALL provide recommendations for future architectural improvements

### Requirement 6: Developer Onboarding Support

**User Story:** As a new developer onboarding to the project, I want clear setup instructions and architectural context, so that I can become productive quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Documentation System SHALL provide a quick-start guide for setting up the development environment
2. THE Documentation System SHALL document the directory structure with explanations of each major folder
3. THE Documentation System SHALL document naming conventions and code organization patterns
4. THE Documentation System SHALL provide examples of common development tasks
5. THE Documentation System SHALL link to relevant external documentation for third-party libraries
