# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines a real-time monitoring dashboard for the device discovery system. The dashboard provides visibility into discovery operations, cache performance, and queue configuration through live metrics visualization. The system addresses the need for operational transparency and debugging capabilities in the device discovery infrastructure.

## Glossary

- **Dashboard**: The React component that displays real-time metrics and visualizations
- **Discovery Metrics**: Statistical data about device discovery operations including success rates, duration, and device counts
- **Cache Stats**: Performance metrics for the device cache including hit rate, size, and eviction counts
- **Queue Config**: Configuration settings for the discovery method queue including strategy and priorities
- **Method**: A device discovery technique (e.g., mDNS, network scan)
- **Snapshot**: A point-in-time capture of discovery metrics
- **Hit Rate**: Percentage of cache lookups that successfully found cached data
- **DebugHUD**: The existing debug heads-up display component where the dashboard will be integrated

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to view real-time discovery metrics, so that I can monitor the health and performance of the device discovery system

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads, THE Dashboard SHALL display aggregate statistics including total discoveries and total devices found
2. WHILE the dashboard is visible, THE Dashboard SHALL update metrics every 1 second without user interaction
3. THE Dashboard SHALL display method-specific performance metrics including success rate and average duration for each discovery method
4. THE Dashboard SHALL display a timeline chart showing discovery duration and device count trends over the last 100 seconds
5. THE Dashboard SHALL complete initial render within 100 milliseconds

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to monitor cache performance, so that I can optimize cache configuration and identify performance issues

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Dashboard SHALL display current cache size and maximum cache capacity
2. THE Dashboard SHALL display cache hit rate as a percentage with visual indicators
3. THE Dashboard SHALL display total cache hits, misses, and evictions
4. WHEN cache hit rate exceeds 80%, THE Dashboard SHALL highlight the metric with a success indicator
5. WHEN cache hit rate falls below 60%, THE Dashboard SHALL highlight the metric with a warning indicator

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to view the current queue configuration, so that I can verify discovery strategy and method priorities

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Dashboard SHALL display the current discovery strategy (sequential, race, or hybrid)
2. THE Dashboard SHALL display each discovery method with its priority value
3. THE Dashboard SHALL display timeout and retry settings for each method
4. THE Dashboard SHALL display enabled/disabled status for each method
5. THE Dashboard SHALL fetch configuration once on mount without polling

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the dashboard to integrate seamlessly with existing debug tools, so that I can access it without disrupting my workflow

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Dashboard SHALL integrate into the existing DebugHUD component as a new tab
2. THE Dashboard SHALL be accessible via a "Discovery" tab in the DebugHUD
3. THE Dashboard SHALL not interfere with existing DebugHUD tabs or functionality
4. THE Dashboard SHALL use zero network calls and read only from local singletons
5. THE Dashboard SHALL consume less than 100KB of memory during operation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the dashboard to be responsive, so that I can view metrics on different screen sizes

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewed on desktop, THE Dashboard SHALL display panels in a multi-column grid layout
2. WHEN viewed on mobile, THE Dashboard SHALL stack panels vertically
3. THE Dashboard SHALL render charts using responsive containers that adapt to viewport size
4. THE Dashboard SHALL maintain readability of metrics and labels at all supported screen sizes
5. THE Dashboard SHALL complete re-renders within 50 milliseconds on data updates

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want custom React hooks for metrics access, so that I can reuse metrics data in other components

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL provide a useDiscoveryMetrics hook that returns method metrics, history, and aggregate statistics
2. THE System SHALL provide a useCacheStats hook that returns cache size, hit rate, and operation counts
3. THE System SHALL provide a useDiscoveryQueueConfig hook that returns current strategy and method configuration
4. THE useDiscoveryMetrics hook SHALL accept a configurable refresh interval with a default of 1000 milliseconds
5. THE useCacheStats hook SHALL accept a configurable refresh interval with a default of 1000 milliseconds

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage, so that I can trust the dashboard's reliability

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL include unit tests for each custom React hook with minimum 8 test cases per hook
2. THE System SHALL include component tests for the dashboard with minimum 12 test cases
3. THE System SHALL include integration tests covering 3 end-to-end scenarios
4. THE Tests SHALL verify interval cleanup on component unmount to prevent memory leaks
5. THE Tests SHALL verify graceful handling of missing or unavailable metrics data
