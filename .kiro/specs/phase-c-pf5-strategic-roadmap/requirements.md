# Requirements Document: Phase C + PF-5 Strategic Roadmap Setup

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for setting up a comprehensive strategic orchestration layer (KIRO) for the K1.reinvented Phase C Node Graph Editor and PF-5 AI-Powered Creative Features initiative. The roadmap spans 30 weeks and coordinates 3-4 engineers across two interdependent feature sets that share a common GraphDocument architecture.

## Glossary

- **KIRO**: Strategic roadmap and orchestration system for high-level project visibility
- **TASKMASTER**: Tactical task execution system for day-to-day engineering work
- **Phase C**: Node Graph Editor - visual pattern design interface (Weeks 1-12)
- **PF-5**: AI-Powered Creative Features - 5-phase AI integration (Weeks 1-30)
- **GraphDocument**: Shared data structure containing nodes, wires, and metadata for LED patterns
- **CSF**: Critical Success Factor - key requirement that must be met for phase success
- **K1Provider**: Existing service that compiles JSON patterns to C++ firmware
